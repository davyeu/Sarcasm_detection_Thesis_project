Anyway, I decided to help out and got one of those accompanying passes to help my wife get to the gate with the kids. We get through the metal detectors, and first off, my wife and baby get randomly selected for swabbing. That was fine but they also wanted to do a thorough check of one of our bins with a carry-on case, my shoes, phone and wallet. Anyway, before they can do our bag, they were taking, I kid you not, twenty minutes to frisk every crevice of a lady in a wheelchair so while waiting I told my wife to just go ahead and take the kids to so she could feed the baby and get food for my son. Finally, they get to our bag, rifle through it and find my wife's breast pump. The security lady swabs it and puts the sample in the machine, and the alarm goes off. I'm told there is an ""inconclusive"" organic substance on my ""child monitor"". I clarify that it's a breast pump so it might be breast milk. Doesn't matter, they need to see my baby. Yep, that's right, they need my baby right away. So I ask for my shoes but the lady says I can't have them. Then they call over a security escort to escort me to find my ""high security risk"" baby and he sees in my socks and says ""you need your shoes on sir"". I reply that they won't give them to me at security. So they conduct a ""pat down"" of my shoes and give them to me. So we are looking for my family and the escort is all impatient and asks ""Can't you just contact them somehow?"" to which I ask ""With what? My phone you won't let me have?"" and he shuts up. We find my family, bring them back and we are explained that because of the inconclusive swab, they have to pat down and swab THE BABY and ONE parent of our choice. Uuuuuh, what? Now remember, they already swabbed the baby and my wife once. I mean it's great that only two of us need to be pat down, but how does that make any sense whatsoever?! So ya, half our family had to be pat down, but one had to be the 7 month old baby. I mean, as much as it would have been annoying, would it not make sense that our whole family had to be pat down? Were they worried our baby was a drug mule or something? And if they were worried, why was patting me down, when I'm not even going on the flight, a viable option? And my son, with his beady little eyes, how come he didn't raise any suspicion at all?! And if none of this makes any sense, why is this even a procedure at all?! Anyway, lesson learned. Never EVER bring a breast pump on carry-on. We only had it in there because our check in case was a tad over the weight limit."

For example, I even got shouted at over voip and kicked from the squad because I went for a bayonet change and when asked for the reason he told me I was a killwhore...and went on for three games to annoy me in chat. Maybe I am just imagining things, or maybe I am getting old. I played LoL and Mw3 for a long time, so I am quite familiar with toxicity.

I have seen a fair share of crazy liberal feminists who believe that women are entitled to everything because they are women, but I have also met plenty more women who work their ass off and achieve everything quite fairly. Now, the minority of women who support the *my choice* abortion are those who are, quite frankly, crazy. Again, those are the 'fringe' parts of liberalism. Classical liberalism is nothing like that. They believe in both rights *and* responsibilities. I am not even a liberal, I am a conservative and so I feel that all men and women should be free to do as they please with their body. The concept of body autonomy is essential to the functioning of human rights. If we do not have body autonomy then everything else falls apart and we certainly should not have the expectation that everyone will defend their freedom with the barrel of a gun because that's not how one should defend their freedom, unless absolutely necessary. Anyway, I think I am digressing a little. Don't use an internet forum as a barometer for what women think, especially two chromosomes. That place is an effective safe space, much like coontown or fatpeoplehate used to be. Plus, a lot of women think that 'being a man' is about acting like a dick and, so, a lot of young feministas basically act like that to try look 'hard and cool', like teenage boys.

In researching their curriculum, I found some reviews that almost scared me off, but I went to a Meetup they hosted and a few other events, talked to alumni, saw how plugged in they are with the local tech community, and I was sold. I heard from multiple people that it's the best decision they've made for their careers. I'm not finished with the program, but so far, I'm inclined to agree. Do some local research if you're considering options. Don't trust Google'd reviews unless it's relevant to your local campus. Scope out the relationships and connections with area tech employers. Talk to alumni, especially; they'll know better than anyone if it's ""worth it"". tl;dr - Maybe."

Hi everyone, Just as hopefully everyone else on this sub, I love this game. But I've been having some difficulties, and I'll list them off in hope that some of you can help me out... 1. Houses. In my recent game I've had a terrible starvation where 90% of my population died off. As a result, my survivors were scattered across the map. So I closed buildings in favour of bunching my people up to close walking distance. So now all my people are living in different houses close together, so instead of at least adults coupling up everyone decided they needed their own house. So now, firewood was being used at an insane rate to heat all these barely populated homes. Do I have to demolish every single house to prevent this? A feature to 'close' houses would be perfect to prevent this perhaps. 2. Maps. As a noob player I find it frustrating to get maps that are littered with hills and lakes. Perhaps it's like that to make the game more challenging but can we have some maps that are flatter (noob friendlier...) that don't force me to stretch my town across thin valleys and make forester lodges a pain in the ass to place. I know there are mods for this but vanilla features for this would be wonderful! P.S. How does everyone manage to feed their town past the 150 population point? Nothing seems to help for me."

I'm not going to go all hypothesis testy for this, but we can certainly calculate a confidence interval on his measurement. If we believe that p = 1/3 and we have enough data points (which at nearly 300,000 we do), we can estimate a standard error for our measured p using sqrt{p(1-p)/n}. A 95% confidence interval would then be 1.96*se(p) = 0.00086. Given the actual data we can say with 95% confidence that misha's true summoning rate falls within the interval 33.38% +- 0.086% or [33.29%, 33.47%]. Increasing n an order of magnitude to just about 3 million games, would bring the lower limit of our confidence interval to 33.35%, which is above 1/3. We would need about 3 million games to more properly test the claim that Misha might be summoned at a rate higher than 1/3.

Start selling downloadable copies of the movie and let word of mouth run its course while still trying to get it screened in public spaces. Or maybe a paid stream option. Like pay $5 and you get to watch it as much as you want for 24hr. Point being this movie needs more distribution methods than just these public screenings because those screenings are under attack and antiMRAs are currently thriving on the fact that its very difficult to watch it. It allows them to spread outright lies about it because its so hard to watch the movie and provide a counter argument. Nothing would shut that shit down faster than, ""No it's not and here are clips of the actual movie to prove it."" or ""Show me where that happens in the movie.""."

I don't know if the President can change that. -Comparative studies among developed countries that show the police killing rate reformers believe the US should aspire to...afaik these countries all have significant structural differences from the US (less untreated mental illness and less driving per capita as well as more provisions to keep guns and even knives out of the hands of troubled individuals). It might be possible that most US police killings are necessary and would occur in France or Canada under the same circumstances; it's just that those circumstances don't happen there as much as there's less driving, meaning less traffic stops and less concern about unarmed suspects squishing cops with 2 tons machinery, as well as better healthcare and better background checks for guns."

You can program the best robot to fight literally anything but it follows a set of rules that can be exploited, learned and outplayed. A titans mind, while vast, is still finite. Take Ronin for example, the sword titan. Often, he states ""We are stronger together, pilot"" and it's true. With his processing speed, algorithms and logic combined with a humans intuition and risk/reward assessment (robots err on one side or the other, a human does not) they can make combined decisions leading to the best outcome. Also. A human can sacrifice themselves, a titan cannot sacrifice their pilot. Alone they are formidable, but together, they are only challenged by an equal."

Aren't the bowl games chosen to be fairly even? I think the title is pretty self explanatory. it seems that total wins and losses in bowl games is given a lot of importance when it comes to comparing the strength of conferences, when to me it seems pretty arbitrary. Part of the criteria for selecting bowl games is that they will be fairly even, and interesting to watch, right? If Penn State loses to USC, that will count against the bowl game record for the Big 10, yet if Penn State had played worse in the regular season and then beaten an easy bowl opponent, that would somehow count *for* the Big 10 being strong? It just doesn't make any sense to me. I guess I can see how it's some sort of metric of ""overratedness"". I.e. if you are assigned an opponent you were considered to be roughly equal to, and then get blown out, then maybe you weren't as good as we thought. But a measure of how ""overrated"" teams are is not directly related to how strong they are. A conference could be assigned a bunch of weak bowl opponents, beat them, and that might not necessarily mean they were any better than a conference that went even with tougher bowl opponents."

Couldn't find this written anywhere online and just tried it myself on 3DS for the first time. I truly hate the buster upgrade in X3. The first shot always comes out slow and forces you to stop dead in your tracks if you're touching the ground, AND the combination spreadshot has very limited applications (it just looks cool for the most part). X2's buster upgrade was so perfect (RIP). So this time I decided to skip it and the gold armor. I am SO GLAD I did. Turns out once you off Zero for his saber without a buster upgrade it now instantly charges as soon as you charge a level 3 shot allowing you to decimate bosses in record time! Its range is very limited and it's not a projectile anymore, but boy it's much faster than suffering through the agonizing seconds it takes to charge up with the upgrade. This may be common knowledge, sorry if it is, but again, I couldn't find this particular detail anywhere else. Just thought I'd share."

So dude's really working it, trying to be funny. All the while she's occupying herself with some task and laughing politely. Dude is laughing hard at his own jokes and straight up ignoring me. Finally the girl sees me and nods in my direction, telling dude to go do his job. When he walks up, I am really pissed off. I'm not really in the business of confronting strangers, but this one bothered me more than usual. So I say loudly, ""hey, glad you could take a break from trying to bang your coworker to take my order."" At this, dude looks quickly to the girl and she visibly recoils and says, ""ugh, what?""

What do women (this can apply to a lot of men as well) do if they don't have hobbies? Maybe its just me but when I meet someone who doesn't have a passion I tend to assume they are shallow and don't think deeply. Any reason why women tend to not have hobbies and what do they do with their time and mind for that matter?"

One of the things I loved most about Fallout New Vegas was Caesar's Legion, in my opinion they're one of the coolest factions in the Fallout world so naturally I started to think about what, if any, role they would play in a new Fallout game. I think we can all agree on that the Legion ending from NV most likely won't be the canon ending. In my opinion the Mr. House ending is going to be, which leaves the question: What will happen to the Legion? I think the Legion will collapse, whether Ceasar lives or not won't change that. Without Caesar's leadership smaller fights will erupt amongst their own ranks, most likely resulting in the Legion splitting up into smaller groups. Some maybe going back to the tribes they originally were. If Caesar lives, this may take a bit longer. More important though, there will be people loyal to the old values of Caesar and the Legion. These splinter groups will, in my opinion, most likely be pushed out of old Legion territory, i.e. Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, and further east. Which brings us to the state of Louisiana, and New Orleans (yeah I know Texas lies between New Mexico and Louisiana but ignore that for now. And Caesar's Legion was supposed to be in Texas anyway so we can work something out) So, here's what I'm thinking: Imagine you're exploring the swamps outside of New Orleans when you come upon a town. The town itself is built upon a small lake and held up by stilts which protects it from higher water levels and floods. This town is basically the New Reno of the region. Filled with booze, drugs, stripclubs and prostitutes. You enter the town and eventually end up talking to the mayor, a bartender or whatever. The person will mention something about a raider gang living deep in the swamp outside of the town and you will get a miscellaneous quest to go check it out. When searching for the gang you will travel on a small path through the swamp, when you're getting close to the quest marker a man dressed in rags with a bomb collar around his neck approaches you. He tells you about his ""employers"" and how they have work for you. He assures that you will be greatly rewarded for your services. He then gives you a quest to go and destroy the booze stills, or something in that style, in the New Reno-ish town. After completing the quest you return to the man and he tells you to follow him. The two of you travel down the small path, and coming up at the end of the path is a camp. Outside the walls of the camp there are people crucified, giving you a hint of what's to come. You enter the camp and is greeted by a person wearing weathered legionary armor. He welcomes you to the camp of The Cohort (or The Zealot's, Zealot's of Caesar or something like that, going to be calling them The Cohort for now) and gives you the story of the Legion, and a recap of what has happened since the second battle of Hoover Dam. This person won't be the leader of the faction but merely one in their ranks. He then proceeds to offer you a place in the group, maybe sending you out on a new quest to prove your worth. You continue to work for The Cohort and learn more about them. I want this really powerfull and mysterious character to lead them, sort of a Lanius figure, brutal but more charismatic. He must have other interests besides destruction. As you progress through the questline you eventually get called up to a meeting with this leader. He praises you for the work you have done and tells you that The Cohort has great plans for the wastes of New Orleans. He tells you about the second coming of The Legion, how you and the rest of his men will unite the tribes and towns of the region and eventually march on New Orleans, claiming it for The Legion. The whole idea of The Cohort is to give the player the choice to revive the dying Legion and finally giving it the Rome it deserves. I want them to have very similar values to those of the Legion, such as prohibiting the use of alcohol and drugs, using slaves and having a totalitarian dictator as a leader. They will also use the same roman hierarchy. I have more ideas but I feel that this is enough for now. Let me know what you think and if you want more. Also feel free to comment if you have any ideas to improve on mine! TL;DR I have this idea of a faction that will originate from Caesar's Legion from Fallout New Vegas that I would love to appear in a new Fallout game. Essentially you would be able to give The Legion its rebirth and unite the wastes of New Oreleans/Louisiana, or wherever the game takes place, under its flag."

I just watched Encino Man (on Netflix) Staring Brendan Frasier, Sean Astin and Pauly shore and have a real problem with the ending. Dave is obsessed over Robyn, the ""girl next door"", he constantly hits on her even though she has a BF, keeps old photos of when they were kids, and finds any excuse to be around her. Throughout the whole movie Robyn never gives any inclination that she sees Dave as more than just a friend even turning down his ""one phone call"" from jail prom proposal. She is nice to him throughout the whole movie, but it is obvious she is not romantically interested in him. However at the end of the movie when Dave sticks up for Link and defends him being a cave man something is supposed to magically change in Robyn where she loses interest in the free spirit Link, and becomes interested in Dave. Even allowing Dave to kiss her at his pool party. The whole movie is unrealistic to an insane degree, but its a fun little adventure. And for some reason Robyn's change of heart is more unbelievable than find a caveman and his counterpart stuck in ice and thawing them out. It's the classic Happy Hollywood Ending. Robyn should have stayed as a friend to Dave, and the ending could have been his self realization that what other think about him, is far less important on how he perceives himself."

1,But the stats say our defense is top 10,Fruit_Rollup_King,cowboys,,-1,-1,0,2016-09,15/09/2016 17:12,"Living in the past, again, forever into the future I posted this in the offseason, looks like it's playing out perfectly again. Last year I was so hyped, and we all felt the same for good reason. Team had played well before...if Randall and DMC could be ok, and if our defense could be just as good as it was (not very good) then there was no reason to think we wouldn't be a pretty damn good team with a nice shot to do well in the playoffs! I remember posting on here, that NOTHING matters if Romo goes down. Well low and behold, Romo goes down and our team falls apart and we have the worst season in recent memory. Our defense was about as crappy as we felt it would be, our running game was pretty damn good as we hoped it would be. So w hy did we suck so hard? We can't close out teams, and even in 2014, we haven't been able to close out a team with our defense for damn near as long as I can remember. In 2014, Romo got us leads and Demarco closed them out. And if that didn't happen, we could always count on Romo to bring us back and give us a chance for that FG or game winning TD IF we got the last possesion. Please note that's our offense: getting us leads closing out games and/or bringing us back from the brink. Our defense rarely ever makes game changing plays when we need them. Because this teams defense SUCKS DICKS at closing out games when we have a lead. I had a feeling that every time we are up by less than 8, and the opponent gets the ball in a situation where they will have the last possession, we're done. We cant' get any pressure on the QB, and in no huddle 2 minute drill it's just way to much pressure on our extremely below average defense to hold onto that lead. We saw it last year in OT 2 times. Neither time did the offense even get on the field and we lost. Reddit and PFF to the rescue here is the data since 2011 in the scenario where the Cowboys are either tied or ahead by less than 8 with 4 minutes to go in the 4th quarter. Dallas has allowed the most TDs in that time with 12. The Vikings have allowed the most total scoring plays with 21 Dallas has lost more games than any other team in the league in this scenario with 15 losses since 2011. That's out of 31 opportunities, which is 48.39% of the time. That's almost a full season worth of losses because our defense can't stop the opponent when it matters most. and in that time, Dallas has the worst percentage of all NFL teams. So with all that being said, looking at our current roster, what reasons do I have to believe our defense is better now at getting press ure and sealing wins. With Romo, there are games we'll win even though the defense gives up points at the end of games as long as there is SOME time left for him to use his magic. But if he goes down, and he probably will at some point, we're doomed. I do believe if we have Romo, and Elliot playing well that we can close out games using our offense, but that's such a damn risky proposition. Because your a one trick pony at that point, and if that pony gets hurt in any significant way, again, we're doomed. ..discuss"

I've often created fun and interesting decks for non-competitive play. I like to try strange decks just to see if I can get them to work. I think it's fun and it's one of the ways I have found to alleviate frustration when grinding ladder. A problem, though, is that I'll make a funky pirate shaman deck or a rogue deck with only two minions, etc. and want to just dick around and have fun with it. I'll go into casual and lose to aggro shaman or control Mage enough times that I feel like I should be playing a ranked deck to have a little more fun, and I'm back to grinding ladder. This brings me to my point. You can choose the class you play against in practice mode, letting you see how your deck fares in certain match ups. I think it would be fun and innovating to be able to choose a deck for the innkeeper to play against you. This could have practical benefits (like a mirror match to test out changes in a ranked deck) or it could be really fun (giving the innkeeper a golden Milhouse Manastorm).

However I feel like what riot generally ends up doing is just nerfing the base stats or damage of a champ like her until she is effectively gutted. There are less drastic ways to nerf her that will still keep her as a viable pick, but not as oppressive. The main thing with her that makes her hilariously busted in my opinion is her ability to trade for free in lane with little to no counterplay for most opposing toplaners. Unless you are playing jax, poppy, or fiora, camille's lane is almost as abusive as renektons with her also scaling better into the game. The main issue is the q2 prep e-aa-q combo, which can deal an upwards of a third of someones health with absolutely no way to deal with it. So what are the best ways to nerf her? -Increased e cooldown in the early levels by a lot, I feel like a ~20 second cd will keep her ability to trade for free down -Remove attack speed buff on e, its a completely unnecessary stat boost and I'm not quite sure why its there -Make her shield health percentage scale by level, starting at 10% and increasing to 20% These nerfs will serve to bring her back in line without going too far, if she still needs nerfs after that she can get looked at again"

Here are some details: This was our first night of a 4 day, 3 night lollipop loop consisting of portions of the Wonderland and Northern Loop Trails. We started from Mowich Lake and stayed at Ipsut Creek, Yellowstone Cliffs, and Cataract Valley. Total trip length was around 25 miles when you factor in side trips. Not the most lengthy trip, but the elevation changes at Mt Rainier can kick your butt (especially if you're a flatlander like me). Ipsut Creek is a great place to camp, because although its technically a back country camp, it used to be a car camp. As such, it has bear bins instead of of poles, and large sites with picnic tables. You can access the camp ground via the Wonderland Trail or from the Carbon River entrance to the park via a road that is now open only to foot and bicycle traffic."

At the time, I was around 25 and he was almost 30. It was his first 'real job' out of college. He apparently grew up in a very sheltered, religious household. His dad is apparently a very high-ranking official in the UN. And due to an unfortunate strings of circumstances, Kevin sat next to me: * Kevin had zero computer skills. As a new employee, the company will issue you the standard computer, 8GB flash drive, along with employee handbook, etc. etc. He refused the flash drive because the size was too small (physically) and he believed it won't have any storage capacity. * So he kept having to borrow my flash drive. He also didn't know how to plug it into his computer and kept complaining that the flash drive is ""broken"". * We're an international company with offices in many countries. So, it goes without saying that we all communicate through email. He drafts EVERY EMAIL (even simple replies) on PAPER and then asks me to proof read it before he sends it out. He works as a COPYWRITER. * He asked me if the ""SEND"" button in Outlook means that his email was sent out. * He has more than once got scammed by those Nigerian Prince emails. He sends them his password when they ask for it. * He likes to google my full name (it's not a common name at all. Only I have it.). He googles it often enough that it pops up every time he types in the first letter of my name on Google. One day, he got so excited and showed it to me because I was ""FAMOUS"" because Google knows my name. * Each month, the housekeeper would walk around and issue out tissue paper to put at our workstation. The first time, he asked me what it was. * He drives the cleaning ladies insane by going into the pantry, use plates and mugs and put them back in the cupboard without washing them. When confronted, his argument was that he'll use it again eventually. * He likes to listen in on conversations. More than once, he would ask me what people in five workstations away were talking about. * He stares at people. ALL. THE. TIME. And stare at your computer screen and comment on what you're working on. * He didn't know how to put staples in staplers. When I helped him with it, his reply: ""Thank you so much. I'm just not used to these new technologies."" * He constantly asks people how much their salary is. * His probation period was extended (understandably. he was still asking me to proofread his emails). When HR told him, he threw a tantrum claiming that they can't do that because he already told his mom that he passed the probation. * He often takes his copywriting work home for his mom to check. This is what I can think of from the top of my head. I'm know there's more as he drove me nuts to the point that I wanted to quit and the Head of HR had to console me. I was his designated babysitter for the duration of his time there. People still joke that one day he might come into the office and shoot everyone. I would be the first to go."

Sorry, i just can't get behind the guy. He has great in ring psychology, a great talker, awesome energy and has the look to make it in the WWE. But inside the ring, every punch, kick, rope move, movement, it just seems completely fake and forced. Two times during the match he did that stupid 2nd rope bounce. First, it never looks real, makes absolutely no sense and takes a stupid amount of preparation to even make the move while the opponent stands there waiting for him to do it. By far the worst move in his arsenal. Every other moves just seems so... fake, like he's a bad physical actor, when i am watching guys like AJ, Seth, Jericho, i can believe that that is a real move within the WWE realm, but the ones done by Ambrose always, always look fake... Can't remember one wrestler who always seems fake. p.s. personal opinion, what do you guys think."

WWE used to mute Cena's reactions, pipe in chants, and run an edited version for the West coast feed (which aired on tape delay) for Cena. At the PPVs they could only mute it but it'd be obvious people were booing Cena, so many people that were on the West Coast would only hear the boos at PPVs and would be surprised. Maybe because of the proliferation of the internet they aren't trying to do that now. But Reigns actually does get cheers and the boos aren't even that bad. He gets booed on his entrance, but he's such a good wrestler that usually during and after his matches the crowd can't help but pop. Cena was a garbage wrestler so he'd just get booed throughout the matches. When Cena would fire up it'd be even worse. When Reigns fires up most people actually like to see the Superman punch and Spear. Cena of course lasted for a decade plus. I'm sure Reigns can do that too. I think Reigns outside of promo work is a way better wrestler than Cena already. He looks cooler, has cooler moves, sells a lot better and works better matches all around.

Thus, it seems likely that the Vanduul are probably being chased into human territory by something even worse "" Well i have an idea. First point is each alian race has that tech that makes them different from humans. The xi'an have the better engine tech. The benu is still unknow ,the tevarin with their boarding ships and the vanduul are unknow also. But here is an idea. What about if the vanduul had the best jump drives. Makes sense as they are nomadic and tribal. So imagine when using their jump drive tech as u jump and look out at the jump tunnel u can see what look like truly demonic sceens. Shapes and monsters almost ripping into the jump tunnel with u. But never do. But in lore it could say that the vanduul pushed their jump drive tech too hard and ripped the jump tunnel open. Be it for a moment. And in come through truly horrific trans dimensional beings. Think of the movie Event horizon. And its this horror that the Vanduul are running from. It could be the new bad guy in 10 years when star citizen needs a reboot. What do u guys think?"

The guilt is not felt as strongly when pirating a large application that pushes millions of units, but when you pirate an application that sells 10 units a day @ $0.99, I can't help but feel bad. If the iTunes store had a try-before-you-buy deal that would be great. However I, like many get bored with App-store games/apps quickly, so the try-before-you-buy deal would likely not give me any incentive to buy in the end. Some dev's are already doing this on their own however. They are releasing 'lite' versions of their games/apps for free, then paid versions and encouraging users to buy the full app. This seems to be the most effective way, as you can't expect Apple to put timers for 'demo' use in place, and you certainly can't expect Apple to put limitations on your application for trial use. If you want to encourage purchases, create a stripped down version for free then use that to encourage users to buy the full game. If the lite version has enough of a hook, users will bite on the full."

0,All I know is that I wouldn't want to be tunnel-brothers with Derrick.,pi22seven,relationships,,1,-1,-1,2016-11,17/11/2016 05:53,"Me with girl I wanted to date but she ended up sleeping with my best friend now upset with me because I don't want to date her Wall of text incoming. You can skip to tl;dr but even that ended up being a little long. This is going to sound like a lot of high school bullshit and really it is. Back story is this. A group of friends and mine eat at a local pub once a week during football season and have done so for about 3 years. A new waitress started working there in July (before the season started but we eat there sometimes outside of game day). She was a knockout, beautiful brunette with really blue eyes. She starts waiting our table and she is very friendly. No big deal, its a waitresses job to be friendly so I never think anything about it. We come back in pre-season and she is still there and once again get our table. This time since we are there for a few hours to watch the game she spends a lot of time with us and she talks with me a lot. Now honestly I'm not the greatest at picking up on social cues, I always just assume that the wait staff is just trying to get an extra tip. But my friends in the past have told me I have blown opportunities when they say a girl was hitting on me so I kind of take a leap of faith here and I ask her if I can text her sometime. We exchange numbers and we start doing some very casual texting. Thursday of that week I have a client in town that I have to entertain for the night and well I thought I'd try my luck and see if she was there. Bingo, she's working and take our table all is good. Again she goes out of her way to stick around and talk with us, we came in late so they were closing and she came over and sat with us for awhile. Again I think things are going great. I text her the next day and tell her how happy I was to see her and she returns the feelings on this. Well Sunday comes we are there and once again she is there. Things go the exact same way so by this time I have really started to think that we are both leading towards something and I just decide that after the game I will ask her if she will go out with me sometime. Of course I do this away from everyone so as to not look creepy or anything. She turns me down flat. She say's that I have misread her and she enjoys talking and texting with me but she is not interested in seeing me in that way. Ouch. I'm a big boy, I apologize for misreading the situation and tell her that I won't trouble her again. Hey you swing you miss, it happens. I was not upset other than what you typically will feel when you get flat out rejected like that, but that's just life. A couple of weeks go by and she was not at work for the first game, which if I'm being honest i was a little relieved about. But she was there for the second one. This is when one of my friends ""Derrick"" leans over and tells me ""hey man you see that waitress there, I've been tapping that now for about 2 weeks"". Okay this all makes some sense now, she was just being friendly around me to get with Derrick, it sucks but hey its life. Now I happen to know that Derrick is a real douche canoe when it comes to women, he is a player and he sticks with them a month or two and then moves on. I like him as a guy but bluntly speaking I'm just not that way so it kind of bugs me when he does that because in the past myself and a few of the other guys have been caught in his damatic shitstorm when he runs into a woman who does not take kindly to this. Anyway I just totally put the whole thing out of my mind until about 2 weeks ago. Derrick as I knew he would dumped her. It really kind of upset some of the guys because he did this with a person where we go to frequently so this is going to be awkward for everyone. Sure as shit she is there when we come in but she did not take our table. It was very obvious that she traded off. However at half time of the game she catches me coming out of the bathroom and she starts chatting me up. I reply to her as I would any other time and then I return to the game. Then on Monday I get a text from her telling me how great it was to talk to me yesterday. I just replied back ""good talking to you as well"". That was it or so I thought. Then all of a sudden she starts texting me every day several times a day. Sometimes I don't even reply to her. Then the next Sunday she is once again working our table but she is totally focusing on me this time and pretty much just gives polite conversation to anyone else. Then when we were all leaving she runs up to me as says ""aren't you even going to say goodbye"", which confused the shit out of me. So I told her goodbye and she say's to me ""hey I've been thinking about you a lot lately and I really would like to go out with you sometime"". At this point I kind of had a feeling that this is where this was headed so I just simply told her ""yea, sorry but once someone tells me that they aren't interested in me then I try and move for my own sanity and that the ship had kind of sailed for that"". She gave me kind of a disgusted grunt and turned and left. It's over right? Wrong. The next day I get a wall of text that was fluctuated between anger and apologizing. Basically she said she spoke with Derrick after I rejected her and she found out that I knew about them. She then went into this long rant about how it was wrong for me to ""slut shame her"" for being with someone else when we were not even a couple. How that it was unfair that I really liked her but now that I found out she was with one of my friends that she was ""dirty"". I'll spare you the rest because it was a train wreck with her ending up apologizing for everything she said at the end. I sent back a very short response to her telling her that her dating Derrick had nothing to do with any of it. That her telling me that she did not think of me that way was the reason for all of it and now I didn't think of her that way. She then sent several texts trying to explain herself and ultimately I just ignored all of them because honestly she sounded like a dumpster fire. I eventually just texted her back and said at the end of the day she is an employee of a place I frequent and that is the relationship that we have. This did not go over well so I blocked her phone. Now WTF do I do about this sunday? As far as I'm concerned I've been going there a lot longer than she worked there, we were never a couple so I do not feel like I need to avoid the place. So if she has any form of attitude or badgers me do I tell her manager or should I try and get everyone to move to a different location? It would be one thing if I did what Derrick did but in the end for some reason I'm the bad guy and I've never even been out with this woman but I'm some sexist pig because she slept with one of my friends and now she thinks that is the reason I don't want to date her. tl;dr: Met waitress who was hot and thought we made a connection but I was wrong, she shot me down. No big deal I move on, one of my friends starts sleeping with her and as is par for his course dumps her after about a month. She then tries to hit me up again and this time I reject her, she flips her shit because she say's I'm sexist for rejecting her because she had sex with one of my friends. This was not the reason but now I'm afraid to go to my local pub."

I've seen a bit of people on YouTube and other social media platforms talking about it so here is my take of it. Atleast for me at my local field it seems like there is less and less players coming. That itself doesn't mean to much because it's just one field but after talking to my friends, even some from out of my state, most if not all said that their local fields are also not getting as many players as the used to get. Does this mean Airsoft is dying? No not at all it just means that it is expanding faster than the current player base can handle. Back in 2012 there was a huge spike of new Airsoft players and a bunch of new fields and Airsoft retailers and manufacturers opened up. Fast forward 4 years and it has leveled back out to its normal rate of players. All of those manufacturers and fields are now hyper splitting the Airsoft community to give the illusion of less players. That is also the reason why we saw a lot of Airsoft manufacturers go out of business because they expected that huge spike to keep going but it leveled out instead of rising more. Airsoft as a whole isn't dying it is just being hyper split across more and more fields. In a few years a bit of fields will go out of business due to the hyper split player base but that will bring larger numbers back into the other fields and the whole spike in player base and hyper splitting will start all over again."

So the more you fidget the less of a risk there is for developing a blood clot. Its basically a mini survival instinct.

Everything is going well, I have annexed naxos, still hold negroponte, and still hold crete. I had to give up Durazzo and Corfu in a past war with the Ottomans. I am pursuing relations with Cypress, with the eventual plan to annex them and have major trade control. While things might seem fine for now, until i have to go to war with the Italian nations, war with the Ottomans is looming. They have a core of Negroponte, Naxos, and Crete, all major points of trade for my nation. I have a great relationship with Austria and Hungary, as well as the papal states, Im afraid that the Ottomans will go down and try to take full control of Greece before even attacking the Hungarian front. Should i start building up forces on the islands of Naxos and Negroponte? Should i produce a better navy to blockade my islands in case of war? Is is even worth it? Should I just give up those islands if war was to happen? I feel like my nation is backed up on a few islands in the Ottoman's territory and there is not much i could do, as the Ottomans have a better navy than me. Please help, as i think losing those provinces would give me a major loss on trade income. Thanks!"

So I'm predicting next week we will see the Halloween update with a 3 week even run similar to the Summer Games. While many want an event currency, I'll predict we don't see it as Blizzard seemed, at least outwardly, satisfied with the even. By running three weeks it would be complete just a bit before Blizzcon. I'm predicting Sombra will be announced mid October with teasers and announced as playable at Blizzcon similar to Eichenwalde at Gamescom. I think we will hear about Overwatch's first new game mode and 2 maps associated with it to be released in December/January timeframe. That's my predictions for the next month or so.

When I was a teenager more than 10 years ago I was a fully committed Muslim who was keen on spreading the word of Mohammed. I went on Paltalk (if any of you remember what that is, it's a voice-chat-room client) and started arguments against Christians and the sort after watching Ahmad Deedat and the works. Then one day an atheist (who's name passes me) asked a simple question: **Here's the argument:** When the devil disobeyed god, god damned him. Damning, meaning the devil will never be allowed into heaven. Then how the hell did the devil sneak back into heaven to trick Adam and Eve? Was God unaware? Was he too weak to guard his borders? What kind of God can't back his own word? This is where I started to logically question all the things I was told, the stories always fell apart when you applied logic. Now, I'm not sure if that particular story has an actual answer or if it is solid. Was the devil waiting for his damnation to be processed by bureaucratic angels? Who knows? But it set something off in me, and I thank those people for making good logical arguments (even though they were pretty snobby and rude about it). It was worth it in the end."

Contracts on the other hand, are amazing. I know many probably ignore them, but it's what kept me playing. It's amazing to outwit a fellow player with knowledge of not just the level but the game mechanics, and twist them. Nothing comes close to this. The issue is, the contract creation is too limiting.

One of the classic tropes of fantasy worlds is that the farther you go out into the wilds the more dangerous it becomes. Cities are safe, and the creatures you find near them are weak, but things get harder farther out. Bosses are always in ""the deepest part of the forest"" and such. It's hard to recreate this feeling in Minecraft because the only only factors affecting mob spawning are light level and the occasional spawner block. **There's little incentive to travel farther from your base than you must to find a dark area.** If you want to fight a lot of mobs, the best way is usually to build a spawn room rather than to explore the wilderness. And if you do decide to find mobs through exploring at night, they're basically the same difficulty anywhere you go. So, **what mods can you think of that could fix this?** I don't know of any, but I've thought of some ideas that could go into one: * The most basic mod for this would be to make beds prevent mob spawning within a radius of a chunk or two. * A more advanced one would have mob spawn rates slowly scale up with increasing distance from a chunk with a bed that's in a villager house or from the world spawn until they've scaled up or above the vanilla spawn rate. This would allow you to build relatively safe cities anywhere by placing a bed, but have wild lands in-between * Spawn rate could also be tied to y-level with the spawn rate increasing back towards or above normal as you dig down even if there's a bed/city above to simulate the classic dungeon-under-the-city trope in caves. (dungeons would also be a cool thing to spawn under villages in general but that's another mod in itself...) I'm not a great java coder, so there isn't a large chance I'll be able to make this myself. Any devs who find it interesting feel free to steal anything here. **What are your thoughts?** are there mods that already cover most of this? What other mods can you think of that would force the player to travel thousands of blocks from their base to explore or setup additional bases far away from their home?"

For such a large city, Chicago has a limited number of venues. The city plays a large part in this, mainly through noise restrictions. Even smaller number of venues where rappers can perform. Now because Chance's dad worked for the mayor's office in the past, people suspect he pulled strings that got him the shows he needed to play early on. I have zero evidence of this but after living in Chicago as a performing artist and witnessing first hand how crooked that city is I don't find it hard to believe."

Obviously this would create a significant amount of political turmoil. But what happens if Obama says: ""The Senate has foregone their constitutional requirement to hold a hearing to honor the President's appointments. If they have no objections, then I will now appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court."" Garland goes and tries to hear court cases an act as a Supreme Court Justice from then on out. What would be the reaction? Immediately obvious would be *substantial* push back by Republicans in the Senate, and such a disagreement would likely lead to the nuclear option and an end to Democratic filibusters. But that might happen regardless of Obama's actions. Would the other Supreme Court justices accept Garland, or refuse him? What happens when Trump comes to power and tries to replace him? Do the other Supreme Court justices accept this, or try to limit this action? If he does succeed in replacing Garland, does this have any potential to have him try and remove other justices for disagreements with him and would those efforts work?"

I found time to write a bit so here it goes! Remember BIL is dating now SIL and he's now thinking of marrying her. We were sitting in the room at the il's house just us three. BIL is talking to DH about it. SIL has a dog that she's had for years. It was a gift to her by her father when he became very ill, near death. The reality hit him that life is short and he decided to start making good on some of his promises before he died. He always told SIL he would get her a dog, they were a military family, and he'd always say the next place we move I'll get it for you. So he got her this dog at that time and she loves her dog and he has sentimental value to her. Now, BIL has not yet met this dog because you know it's serious when you meet the dog. BIL sates to DH: Well the dog has to go. I have allergies and I can't be living with a dog. I know the dog has sentimental meaning for her because of her dad but my health is more important than a dog. She's waiting for me to meet the dog because she wants him to slowly warm up to me. This is stupid, it's just a dog... I don't see what the big deal is. I want to marry her but if we get married we'll already have to get an apartment and that costs money there (both of them at the time were living with their parents and would meet each other for dates and such). If we keep the dog then we have to pay extra money for pet rent and I'm not paying extra money for a dog!!! DH is just nodding his head and listening (he's pretty laid back and quiet always like this guess it's true opposites attract). I'm thinking how rude is this guy? He wants to marry her and is supposed to love her but can't have compassion for what she loves??? I know he's SNOT JR. For sure. Anyway he meets the dog and they get engaged. They have all these big events that I find my way out of because I can't stand being around them. They had a family celebration right after he proposed and a joint couple shower. SNW knows how creative and crafty I am, especially after my wonderful diy wedding decor, so she asks me to help her decorate for the rehearsal dinner. I reluctantly agree to help her. DH and I have been married over 3 years at this point. SNW has never made any efforts to call, text, smoke signal, or communicate with me in any way or form any relationship with me. Can't remember if I posted about this before but I did invite her to an event to be the bigger person, but she basically fought me even giving it to her. The event was based on a book and I wanted to buy her the book and put the tickets inside as a Christmas gift. She was like oh I don't want a book. And then proceeded to text DH about how she doesn't want whatever I'm trying to get her, that he knows the type of gifts she likes and to stick to that. I was so angry... I was raised knowing when people get you a gift you accept because the person thought about you and took their time to get it for you so be grateful! Guess not everyone learned that. I still invite her after my moms advise but said well I was trying to do this for you but since you didn't want it I'm asking you now would you like to go with me. Then she's like oh I would love to go I had no idea thats what it was, super nice in front of everyone. We went to the event and she straight up did not talk to me the whole time and went off in her own during the intermissions. Sorry for going off topic but you get the point. Now all of a sudden she's blowing me up about this wedding rehearsal. She texts several times a day and calls about her ideas and sends me pics. She's always like Hi how are you then goes for what she wants... I'm not fooled at all, she never cared how I was doing for over three years. She says Oh well SIL and I have been talking about the plans and blah blah blah. Basically trying to run in my face that she talks to SIL all the time and she's being involved in the planning. unlike with my wedding, but that's because she got mad at me for not doing what she wanted and did CBF the rest of the time I was planning. I tell DH about this sudden change of behavior and how much involved SNW is in this wedding as compared to ours. He suggests well maybe because she has a good relationship with SIL she realizes she needs to do better with you and this is her way of reaching out to you... I say maybe but I know its all fake..."

And no, I'm not referring to all the Cassie Porn. 1 Word: FURRIES. Furries seem to loe this game, for some reason, especially thanks to Pip. He's paired with EVERYONE, from Fernando to Bomb King. Drogoz is another big favorite. Now, imagine if, instead of the new Champion, we would have had an Actual Bear, or Bear Like Character, be it female or male. (I know from Smite that Hi Rez seems to have a problem with depicting monstrous or not-humanoid women, but *bear* with me (Eh)). Just think about the INFLUX of new players and fanart. Think of the MONEY, Hi Rez! All that sweet, untapped and quite sweaty money the furries would give you! Also, adding another generic badass normal character kind of takes away Victor Awesomes of being able to go toe to toe with Witches, Dragons and God Slayers with just an assault riffle and some grenades. So, Hi Rez, learn your lesson, stop releasing generic base female characters with generic kits and instead start releasing more animal-based characters, and you'll basically hit the jackpot."

Societies aren't isolated entities competing to receive credit for scientific advances. To suggest that it is even possible to ""trace the ups and downs of that path solely from the west's perspective"" is laughable. The Chinese were way in the vanguard up until the Roman Empire, and many of their ""advances"" filtered west to Europe. When Rome fell, the Middle East inherited Classical knowledge and advanced it, passing the torch back to Renaissance Europe, which in turn sought out knowledge, wealth and technology from the Far East. As you point out, gunpowder was invented in China. Modern warfare would be impossible without it. Imagine modern science without calculus or, for that matter, the number ""zero,"" which the Romans lacked. Imagine how western culture would have developed without the Moorish/Arabic concept of chivalry. It is, in fact, quite unreasonable to trace the advances of any civilization from just one perspective. Political correctness? How about historical correctness?"

Less grind = more fun for everyone. Without factories on Civ - you couldn't do much at all. Here, you can thrive with or without them. No, I don't hate Civcraft because I do play fairly often and I've made quite the bunch of friends there. I've seen development yet it was very slow. But this ain't no complainin post about Civ. This is my post about appreciating devoted for what it is. So even though I just started devoted and I knew right from the start when 3.0 of devoted launched that the experience would be amazing and I wasn't dissapointed. This server is great. To the staff: keep up the hard work! If you agree with me, leave an upvote or reply with your thoughts on Devoted! Thanks for your time. Stay dank. -tnug out."

It's Curry in the sense that it's his team. The system doesn't function if he's not there, and everything's been built to account for his overwhelming offensive presence. It's Draymond in the sense that he's the pillar of the system that makes everything flow and allows us to run so many good lineups on the floor. I think if you replace Curry with another star guard (anyone as good as Westbrook/Harden down to Walker or Thomas) we're still the best team in the league. If you replace Draymond with a standard PF we don't go 73-9 and we probably struggle in a Bo7 against Cleveland or the Clippers"

The relevance is that 1 month ago in Missouri, the Missouri Information Awareness Center (a department of homeland security 'fusion' center where local, state, and federal law enforcement 'share' information and other resources) put out a report regarding the modern militia movement as it pertains to domestic terrorism. In one passage of this document, it stated that supporters of 3rd party political candidates (including Ron Paul, though he technically is an R) are more likely to be militia members. This is also relevant, because the incident took place in St. Louis, Missouri.

I know we're young. I know it's a long season. But nothing about the way the Denver Nuggets have played this year has inspired any confidence in Michael Malone's ability to gameplan, distribute minutes, or adjust on the fly.

Hey all, So WoW has gotten a bit stale for me even though I love the game. Been playing since Vanilla and I love the game in and out. However a lot of my friends have moved on and I've found myself not communicating with anyone anymore. I love going on but I find that within an hour or so, I just get bored and sign off because I really have no one to talk to. Guilds don't really feel like a community either, so I just feel sort of isolated. I am just looking for some people to chill with in game and do things. I'm between Regular Mythics and M+, but can never find groups. I don't really PvP due to my crushing lack of friends in game. This may just sound like me crying on the internet, but I really want to get onto WoW and have people to talk to/do things with. If you want to add me to BNet my BattleTag is Shakencakes#1636 (I am also on the Buddy List). My alliance characters are on Emerald Dream and my Horde is on KJ. I just felt like I needed to do something to put myself out there and try to make some WoW friends again. Thanks for listening and have a great holiday! =)"

When they persecute us, this means the Torah is getting fulilled and it also helps us to consolidate our tribe and not assimilate among them. Also, these idolatarian Christian Goys with reddish faces and hairs are the descendants of Edom(=red), and our Rabbi says that they're kind of like animals, barely human, and just like the wild animals don't like to have masters, these goys alike don't like to have masters! But as the Torah says, we will be masters and we will give a lot of loans to other nations, but we will take no loan. Also, the descendants o Jacob (=Jews) will destroy the descendants of Edom (=Christians) just like it's written in the Torah, and the Torah is what we repeat every day and on each prayer, so this belief is deeply embedded into our subconsciousness..."""

After he sold it, the company that bought it (forget who) turned the antivirus into a bloated piece of shit which under-performed, and wormed its way into your OS to a point where you basically couldn't get rid of it.

And it doesn't mean there are no talented women (really?); just that by-and-large women and men tend to have slightly different talents and inclinations. What we need is equality of opportunity, and a willingness not to stereotype on the basis of aggregate behaviours, rather than equality of outcome. By far my best ever boss was a woman: calm, collected, fair, highly-competent, and treated everyone with respect. There are lots of good, intelligent women out there doing good work.

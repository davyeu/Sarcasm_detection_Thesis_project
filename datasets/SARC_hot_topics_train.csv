Instead of redefining sentencing for all non-violent criminals let's just close down those jails like they asked, let's see what happens given the following scenario: Ana and Bob both sell marijuana in states that don't allow that. They both get caught. Bob goes to court and says he only does it so he can pay for school or something. Gets sentenced to prison for however long the sentence is. Ana goes to court and has a similar excuse, but Ana is a woman so there is no prison to put her in, and instead she goes through a community treatment and comes out a better person who doesn't sell drugs anymore. Which is great, but this opportunity wasn't offered to Bob, who only wanted to go to school or make rent this month. The author of this article brought up good points, but they can benefit people of both genders, it doesn't have to be only about women. And they even acknowledge it too, that there's a movement to put less men in jail as well. You'd think they'd try to get together and say ""let's stop putting **everybody** in jail for non-violent offenses."" The goal is similar, why can't they work together?"

You have less population overall, less population density, you have actual social, health and economic safety nets that dissuade a life of crime of the likes that takes place in the states. I don't like gun control on principle because it accuses the majority of gun owners as being potential killers. I don't know about you over in Australia but here people are innocent until proven guilty. This isn't Minority Report, we don't have pre-crime laws on the books. I don't take too kindly as being seen by default too childish to own and be trusted with the types of weapons you guys over there don't have access to. I have absolutely ZERO to do with the doings of mass shooters. We are separate entities and their actions don't reflect on me in any way. I have no responsibility what so ever to give up my weapons because someone somewhere might lose it and commit murder. The likelihood of being killed in a mass shooting is so remote it's not even worth worrying about. It's the news and the anti-gun types that hype it up to sensationalized and clownish proportions to scare monger everyone into a gun banning and confiscating frenzy. Most ""gun violence"" statistics in this country is inflated due to the numbers being padded by police shootings and suicide. More people are killed by blunt objects, hands and cars than guns in this country but a certain subset of people don't want you to know that. It's socio-economics that's at fault, NOT the firearms. It's a deeply worrisome cop out to blame the firearm instead of the individual. Whatever happened to individual responsibility?"

I apologize for the following wall of text. ForcedToJoin... Just wow. You don't do math well. Mass shootings make up less than one percent of gun deaths. Even if you were speaking about gun deaths in general, good luck changing the laws. Let me school you about 2011. Handguns killed the most people, out of all weapons. About 7k out of the total 10k homicides. Handguns are protected under DC vs. Heller, a la Supreme Court. Summarizing in the most basic and reductionist fashion, they cannot be banned, as such a ban is unconstitutional. That's not my opinion, it is the decision of the Supreme Court. So. The most prolific killers are unbannable. Knives were way down the list. Lower still were homicides in which the 'weapons' were bare hands. Below them, bats and clubs. Below them, guess for me... Rifles. Killed ~200 people, or about two percent of homicides. Handguns were seventy percent. Let me simplify that for you: 2% rifles, 70% handguns. Now, this includes all types of rifles: hunting rifles of numerous levels of lethality, .22 target rifles, varmint rifles, competition rifles in many forms, long distance rifles, anti-materiel rifles (ie massive)' the list goes on. Lets break that down a bit. Where do ""assault weapons"" fit? Can you guess? Dead last. The caliber of ammunition used by the AR-15 (.223) and the AK-47 (7.62x39) were tied for last. As in, every other caliber that killed people killed more people than those of the two most popular and numerous ""assault weapons"". One of which is the best selling rifle in America. Let's move on. Self-protection. It is not a right granted to us, it is a right recognized as pre-dating the formation of the United States. That is what the constitution is. It does not grant rights to citizens. It prohibits the government from impeding the rights that it lists. The document is not written to the people, but written to the state, limiting it. One of those rights that cannot be impeded by the government is private possession of arms. Back in the day, way back when the constitution was written, muskets were the military weapon du jour. The second amendment protected the right of private citizens to own military arms. Not military style, as an AR-15 is, but military issue, as an automatic M-16 or M-4 is. The standard military rifle. The second amendment did not mention muskets, or AR-15s. The first amendment did not mention the internet, or hip-hop, or WikiLeaks. They are living statutes, designed to stand the test of time by being applicable to new developments and future problems. I'm not going to argue for fully automatic weapons to be released from their constraints. They are legal already, if one follows the relevant laws and processes (NFA paperwork, buying a tax stamp, the process is fascinating). Automatic weapons aren't about defense. Semi-automatic weapons are. Semi-automatic weapons for defense purposes, sounds right to me. Concealed carry legislation is active in well over 35 states. Open carry is active in even more. Ownership and storage in the home is available to you and I no matter where we might live in the United States. Now, do you think concealed carry permit holders commit less crime than the general public, or more? How about violent crime specifically? Let's make this even better: who commits more crime, the police or CCW holders? Do I need to answer this? CCW holders commit less crime than the population at large. Their rate of violent crime is an order of magnitude below their infinitesimally low rate of crime in general. Police are often our protectors. We trust them with guns, guns they carry every day. Officers usually have a shotgun or an AR-15 in their vehicle at all times. They are allowed fully automatic weapons. They are allowed explosives and what the ATF terms 'destructive devices' a large category of things that go boom. CCW holders commit less crime than police officers. The police are much more well behaved than the general population, despite what we see on Law &amp; Order and CSI and other creations of the entertainment industry. They are, for the most part, clean as a whistle. CCW holders, average citizens without police academy training, people just like you and me, have a crime rate even lower than these upstanding men and women in blue. This is not knocking cops, this is just statistics. So, who is making things unsafe for others? Gun owners? CCW holders? Black rifles (as in AR-15s and more, a class of 'scary' weapons that are made black and have no choice in the matter)? Nope. Not them, the numbers remove any doubt in my mind, those people are not the problem. You know what I think the problem is? What causes so much mass murder? The reason for Columbine and Aurora and Sandy Hook? Humans. We are flawed, we are fallible, some of us are sick physically or mentally, some of us are kind while others are bloodthirsty. The same day as Sandy Hook, there was a madman who went on a rampage in China. He entered a school, wounded many adults, and stabbed 20+ children with a very large knife. Some lived, as the school was within a block of a hospital. That madman had no access to guns. Had he swung that knife any harder, he would have racked up a body count higher than all but a handful of the mass shootings in the US. Will we ban pointed kitchen knives, as the UK is considering? Of course not. Knives don't get up and kill people. They have purpose, they have use, but they aren't a protected right in the US. We could pass such legislation. We won't. Guns are similar, but are constitutionally protected to boot. Tell me what OP's options 'should be' again? You say you don't think owning a firearm should be an option, that OP should not have the right to own one and defend herself with it. You give shitty justifications for your opinion. Her right is guaranteed, and has been for 230+ years. Your opinion, in the face of her right, is as a fly in the face of a truck. Better still, you should already know this, and I believe you do. No amount of emotion or outcry will outweigh law, unless it changes the law. People like you are trying that. They are failing miserably in their quest to restrict private citizens from owning guns for defense. If they succeed someday, your words will pull more weight. I respect your right to have your opinion. I don't respect your opinion. You do no detailed research to back it up. You know next to nothing about the multiple facets that comprise this issue. Maybe you should do some digging, I am not being sarcastic. If you are serious about your stance, you will back it up with data, not supposition. I challenge you. Prove me wrong. I bow to truth, and if my understanding of that truth is ill-conceived and fatally flawed, this is something I would desperately like to know. This isn't about emotion. This is about studying reality, and I want you to change mine. If you can."

0,This is how I am going to explain it next time someone asks me why they need pilots.,Discordic00,titanfall,,2,-1,-1,2016-11,21/11/2016 23:56,"Mainly because of human unpredictability. You can program the best robot to fight literally anything but it follows a set of rules that can be exploited, learned and outplayed. A titans mind, while vast, is still finite. Take Ronin for example, the sword titan. Often, he states ""We are stronger together, pilot"" and it's true. With his processing speed, algorithms and logic combined with a humans intuition and risk/reward assessment (robots err on one side or the other, a human does not) they can make combined decisions leading to the best outcome. Also. A human can sacrifice themselves, a titan cannot sacrifice their pilot. Alone they are formidable, but together, they are only challenged by an equal."

It did the job, did it well, and didn't mess with your computer. John McAfee, who created it and is brilliant, sold the company for millions, basically retired and ex-patriot-ed himself to do whatever he felt like at the moment (which apparently included lots of drugs and hookers). After he sold it, the company that bought it (forget who) turned the antivirus into a bloated piece of shit which under-performed, and wormed its way into your OS to a point where you basically couldn't get rid of it. This is McAfee's fuck-you to the company that took his product and made his name into a joke in the IT community. In other words, McAfee got based."

As Rubaberoc well said in another post and i quote ""seeing as the Vanduul are based off of the Vandals, that hints at something: The Vandals were pushed into Roman territory because they were fleeing the even bigger and nastier threat of the Huns. Thus, it seems likely that the Vanduul are probably being chased into human territory by something even worse "" Well i have an idea. First point is each alian race has that tech that makes them different from humans. The xi'an have the better engine tech. The benu is still unknow ,the tevarin with their boarding ships and the vanduul are unknow also. But here is an idea. What about if the vanduul had the best jump drives. Makes sense as they are nomadic and tribal. So imagine when using their jump drive tech as u jump and look out at the jump tunnel u can see what look like truly demonic sceens. Shapes and monsters almost ripping into the jump tunnel with u. But never do. But in lore it could say that the vanduul pushed their jump drive tech too hard and ripped the jump tunnel open. Be it for a moment. And in come through truly horrific trans dimensional beings. Think of the movie Event horizon. And its this horror that the Vanduul are running from. It could be the new bad guy in 10 years when star citizen needs a reboot. What do u guys think?"

WWE used to mute Cena's reactions, pipe in chants, and run an edited version for the West coast feed (which aired on tape delay) for Cena. At the PPVs they could only mute it but it'd be obvious people were booing Cena, so many people that were on the West Coast would only hear the boos at PPVs and would be surprised. Maybe because of the proliferation of the internet they aren't trying to do that now. But Reigns actually does get cheers and the boos aren't even that bad. He gets booed on his entrance, but he's such a good wrestler that usually during and after his matches the crowd can't help but pop. Cena was a garbage wrestler so he'd just get booed throughout the matches. When Cena would fire up it'd be even worse. When Reigns fires up most people actually like to see the Superman punch and Spear. Cena of course lasted for a decade plus. I'm sure Reigns can do that too. I think Reigns outside of promo work is a way better wrestler than Cena already. He looks cooler, has cooler moves, sells a lot better and works better matches all around. Heck even his promos, I see more potential, because Cena would just make kiddy jokes mostly."

You can skip to tl;dr but even that ended up being a little long. This is going to sound like a lot of high school bullshit and really it is. Back story is this. A group of friends and mine eat at a local pub once a week during football season and have done so for about 3 years. A new waitress started working there in July (before the season started but we eat there sometimes outside of game day). She was a knockout, beautiful brunette with really blue eyes. She starts waiting our table and she is very friendly. No big deal, its a waitresses job to be friendly so I never think anything about it. We come back in pre-season and she is still there and once again get our table. This time since we are there for a few hours to watch the game she spends a lot of time with us and she talks with me a lot. Now honestly I'm not the greatest at picking up on social cues, I always just assume that the wait staff is just trying to get an extra tip. But my friends in the past have told me I have blown opportunities when they say a girl was hitting on me so I kind of take a leap of faith here and I ask her if I can text her sometime. We exchange numbers and we start doing some very casual texting. Thursday of that week I have a client in town that I have to entertain for the night and well I thought I'd try my luck and see if she was there. Bingo, she's working and take our table all is good. Again she goes out of her way to stick around and talk with us, we came in late so they were closing and she came over and sat with us for awhile. Again I think things are going great. I text her the next day and tell her how happy I was to see her and she returns the feelings on this. Well Sunday comes we are there and once again she is there. Things go the exact same way so by this time I have really started to think that we are both leading towards something and I just decide that after the game I will ask her if she will go out with me sometime. Of course I do this away from everyone so as to not look creepy or anything. She turns me down flat. She say's that I have misread her and she enjoys talking and texting with me but she is not interested in seeing me in that way. Ouch. I'm a big boy, I apologize for misreading the situation and tell her that I won't trouble her again. Hey you swing you miss, it happens. I was not upset other than what you typically will feel when you get flat out rejected like that, but that's just life. A couple of weeks go by and she was not at work for the first game, which if I'm being honest i was a little relieved about. But she was there for the second one. This is when one of my friends ""Derrick"" leans over and tells me ""hey man you see that waitress there, I've been tapping that now for about 2 weeks"". Okay this all makes some sense now, she was just being friendly around me to get with Derrick, it sucks but hey its life. Now I happen to know that Derrick is a real douche canoe when it comes to women, he is a player and he sticks with them a month or two and then moves on. I like him as a guy but bluntly speaking I'm just not that way so it kind of bugs me when he does that because in the past myself and a few of the other guys have been caught in his damatic shitstorm when he runs into a woman who does not take kindly to this. Anyway I just totally put the whole thing out of my mind until about 2 weeks ago. Derrick as I knew he would dumped her. It really kind of upset some of the guys because he did this with a person where we go to frequently so this is going to be awkward for everyone. Sure as shit she is there when we come in but she did not take our table. It was very obvious that she traded off. However at half time of the game she catches me coming out of the bathroom and she starts chatting me up. I reply to her as I would any other time and then I return to the game. Then on Monday I get a text from her telling me how great it was to talk to me yesterday. I just replied back ""good talking to you as well"". That was it or so I thought. Then all of a sudden she starts texting me every day several times a day. Sometimes I don't even reply to her. Then the next Sunday she is once again working our table but she is totally focusing on me this time and pretty much just gives polite conversation to anyone else. Then when we were all leaving she runs up to me as says ""aren't you even going to say goodbye"", which confused the shit out of me. So I told her goodbye and she say's to me ""hey I've been thinking about you a lot lately and I really would like to go out with you sometime"". At this point I kind of had a feeling that this is where this was headed so I just simply told her ""yea, sorry but once someone tells me that they aren't interested in me then I try and move for my own sanity and that the ship had kind of sailed for that"". She gave me kind of a disgusted grunt and turned and left. It's over right? Wrong. The next day I get a wall of text that was fluctuated between anger and apologizing. Basically she said she spoke with Derrick after I rejected her and she found out that I knew about them. She then went into this long rant about how it was wrong for me to ""slut shame her"" for being with someone else when we were not even a couple. How that it was unfair that I really liked her but now that I found out she was with one of my friends that she was ""dirty"". I'll spare you the rest because it was a train wreck with her ending up apologizing for everything she said at the end. I sent back a very short response to her telling her that her dating Derrick had nothing to do with any of it. That her telling me that she did not think of me that way was the reason for all of it and now I didn't think of her that way. She then sent several texts trying to explain herself and ultimately I just ignored all of them because honestly she sounded like a dumpster fire. I eventually just texted her back and said at the end of the day she is an employee of a place I frequent and that is the relationship that we have. This did not go over well so I blocked her phone. Now WTF do I do about this sunday? As far as I'm concerned I've been going there a lot longer than she worked there, we were never a couple so I do not feel like I need to avoid the place. So if she has any form of attitude or badgers me do I tell her manager or should I try and get everyone to move to a different location? It would be one thing if I did what Derrick did but in the end for some reason I'm the bad guy and I've never even been out with this woman but I'm some sexist pig because she slept with one of my friends and now she thinks that is the reason I don't want to date her. tl;dr: Met waitress who was hot and thought we made a connection but I was wrong, she shot me down. No big deal I move on, one of my friends starts sleeping with her and as is par for his course dumps her after about a month. She then tries to hit me up again and this time I reject her, she flips her shit because she say's I'm sexist for rejecting her because she had sex with one of my friends. This was not the reason but now I'm afraid to go to my local pub."

I don't have a 4k tv and not planning on buying one soon (got a full hd tv, also a 1440p monitor but those aren't supported afaik) As i could get a normal ps4 pretty cheap now, is the pro version worth the 100-200 extra bucks? I'm kinda buying it just for TLOU, will the game benefit of the better hardware? I know everything with TLOU 2 is more of a speculation thing but i wanted to get some other opinions before buying :)"

I don't know if the President can change that. -Comparative studies among developed countries that show the police killing rate reformers believe the US should aspire to...afaik these countries all have significant structural differences from the US (less untreated mental illness and less driving per capita as well as more provisions to keep guns and even knives out of the hands of troubled individuals). It might be possible that most US police killings are necessary and would occur in France or Canada under the same circumstances; it's just that those circumstances don't happen there as much as there's less driving, meaning less traffic stops and less concern about unarmed suspects squishing cops with 2 tons machinery, as well as better healthcare and better background checks for guns."

It's Draymond in the sense that he's the pillar of the system that makes everything flow and allows us to run so many good lineups on the floor. I think if you replace Curry with another star guard (anyone as good as Westbrook/Harden down to Walker or Thomas) we're still the best team in the league. If you replace Draymond with a standard PF we don't go 73-9 and we probably struggle in a Bo7 against Cleveland or the Clippers"

Start selling downloadable copies of the movie and let word of mouth run its course while still trying to get it screened in public spaces. Or maybe a paid stream option. Like pay $5 and you get to watch it as much as you want for 24hr. Point being this movie needs more distribution methods than just these public screenings because those screenings are under attack and antiMRAs are currently thriving on the fact that its very difficult to watch it. It allows them to spread outright lies about it because its so hard to watch the movie and provide a counter argument. Nothing would shut that shit down faster than, ""No it's not and here are clips of the actual movie to prove it."" or ""Show me where that happens in the movie.""."

I disagree with quota hiring because every hire should be made on the basis of merit at the time of appointment. So yes, it may be that quotas do lead to some women being hired to positions for which they are not the best-qualified candidate. But even that is just supposition. And it doesn't mean there are no talented women (really?); just that by-and-large women and men tend to have slightly different talents and inclinations. What we need is equality of opportunity, and a willingness not to stereotype on the basis of aggregate behaviours, rather than equality of outcome. By far my best ever boss was a woman: calm, collected, fair, highly-competent, and treated everyone with respect. There are lots of good, intelligent women out there doing good work. And women are not the enemy. We'll just end up as warped and bitter as feminists if we go down that path."

Couldn't find this written anywhere online and just tried it myself on 3DS for the first time. I truly hate the buster upgrade in X3. The first shot always comes out slow and forces you to stop dead in your tracks if you're touching the ground, AND the combination spreadshot has very limited applications (it just looks cool for the most part). X2's buster upgrade was so perfect (RIP). So this time I decided to skip it and the gold armor. I am SO GLAD I did. Turns out once you off Zero for his saber without a buster upgrade it now instantly charges as soon as you charge a level 3 shot allowing you to decimate bosses in record time! Its range is very limited and it's not a projectile anymore, but boy it's much faster than suffering through the agonizing seconds it takes to charge up with the upgrade. This may be common knowledge, sorry if it is, but again, I couldn't find this particular detail anywhere else. Just thought I'd share."

I found time to write a bit so here it goes! Remember BIL is dating now SIL and he's now thinking of marrying her. We were sitting in the room at the il's house just us three. BIL is talking to DH about it. SIL has a dog that she's had for years. It was a gift to her by her father when he became very ill, near death. The reality hit him that life is short and he decided to start making good on some of his promises before he died. He always told SIL he would get her a dog, they were a military family, and he'd always say the next place we move I'll get it for you. So he got her this dog at that time and she loves her dog and he has sentimental value to her. Now, BIL has not yet met this dog because you know it's serious when you meet the dog. BIL sates to DH: Well the dog has to go. I have allergies and I can't be living with a dog. I know the dog has sentimental meaning for her because of her dad but my health is more important than a dog. She's waiting for me to meet the dog because she wants him to slowly warm up to me. This is stupid, it's just a dog... I don't see what the big deal is. I want to marry her but if we get married we'll already have to get an apartment and that costs money there (both of them at the time were living with their parents and would meet each other for dates and such). If we keep the dog then we have to pay extra money for pet rent and I'm not paying extra money for a dog!!! DH is just nodding his head and listening (he's pretty laid back and quiet always like this guess it's true opposites attract). I'm thinking how rude is this guy? He wants to marry her and is supposed to love her but can't have compassion for what she loves??? I know he's SNOT JR. For sure. Anyway he meets the dog and they get engaged. They have all these big events that I find my way out of because I can't stand being around them. They had a family celebration right after he proposed and a joint couple shower. SNW knows how creative and crafty I am, especially after my wonderful diy wedding decor, so she asks me to help her decorate for the rehearsal dinner. I reluctantly agree to help her. DH and I have been married over 3 years at this point. SNW has never made any efforts to call, text, smoke signal, or communicate with me in any way or form any relationship with me. Can't remember if I posted about this before but I did invite her to an event to be the bigger person, but she basically fought me even giving it to her. The event was based on a book and I wanted to buy her the book and put the tickets inside as a Christmas gift. She was like oh I don't want a book. And then proceeded to text DH about how she doesn't want whatever I'm trying to get her, that he knows the type of gifts she likes and to stick to that. I was so angry... I was raised knowing when people get you a gift you accept because the person thought about you and took their time to get it for you so be grateful! Guess not everyone learned that. I still invite her after my moms advise but said well I was trying to do this for you but since you didn't want it I'm asking you now would you like to go with me. Then she's like oh I would love to go I had no idea thats what it was, super nice in front of everyone. We went to the event and she straight up did not talk to me the whole time and went off in her own during the intermissions. Sorry for going off topic but you get the point. Now all of a sudden she's blowing me up about this wedding rehearsal. She texts several times a day and calls about her ideas and sends me pics. She's always like Hi how are you then goes for what she wants... I'm not fooled at all, she never cared how I was doing for over three years. She says Oh well SIL and I have been talking about the plans and blah blah blah. Basically trying to run in my face that she talks to SIL all the time and she's being involved in the planning. unlike with my wedding, but that's because she got mad at me for not doing what she wanted and did CBF the rest of the time I was planning. I tell DH about this sudden change of behavior and how much involved SNW is in this wedding as compared to ours. He suggests well maybe because she has a good relationship with SIL she realizes she needs to do better with you and this is her way of reaching out to you... I say maybe but I know its all fake..."

I played the first 3-4 of them and then I didn't care, and when I found out you can literally DIE and restart before the game goes back, I saw zero point in doing them, as it ruined the tension. Contracts on the other hand, are amazing. I know many probably ignore them, but it's what kept me playing. It's amazing to outwit a fellow player with knowledge of not just the level but the game mechanics, and twist them. Nothing comes close to this. The issue is, the contract creation is too limiting.

I'm not going to go all hypothesis testy for this, but we can certainly calculate a confidence interval on his measurement. If we believe that p = 1/3 and we have enough data points (which at nearly 300,000 we do), we can estimate a standard error for our measured p using sqrt{p(1-p)/n}. A 95% confidence interval would then be 1.96*se(p) = 0.00086. Given the actual data we can say with 95% confidence that misha's true summoning rate falls within the interval 33.38% +- 0.086% or [33.29%, 33.47%]. Increasing n an order of magnitude to just about 3 million games, would bring the lower limit of our confidence interval to 33.35%, which is above 1/3. We would need about 3 million games to more properly test the claim that Misha might be summoned at a rate higher than 1/3. (at least for p-value of 0.05 and a 2-sided interval, and maybe other things I'm forgetting at the moment.)"

I've often created fun and interesting decks for non-competitive play. I like to try strange decks just to see if I can get them to work. I think it's fun and it's one of the ways I have found to alleviate frustration when grinding ladder. A problem, though, is that I'll make a funky pirate shaman deck or a rogue deck with only two minions, etc. and want to just dick around and have fun with it. I'll go into casual and lose to aggro shaman or control Mage enough times that I feel like I should be playing a ranked deck to have a little more fun, and I'm back to grinding ladder. This brings me to my point. You can choose the class you play against in practice mode, letting you see how your deck fares in certain match ups. I think it would be fun and innovating to be able to choose a deck for the innkeeper to play against you. This could have practical benefits (like a mirror match to test out changes in a ranked deck) or it could be really fun (giving the innkeeper a golden Milhouse Manastorm). It could even be used to mess with deck interplay (thief rogue against a stacked deck). What do you guys think?"

This is from my recollections of changelog articles when Nougat developer previews came out early this year.

One of the classic tropes of fantasy worlds is that the farther you go out into the wilds the more dangerous it becomes. Cities are safe, and the creatures you find near them are weak, but things get harder farther out. Bosses are always in ""the deepest part of the forest"" and such. It's hard to recreate this feeling in Minecraft because the only only factors affecting mob spawning are light level and the occasional spawner block. **There's little incentive to travel farther from your base than you must to find a dark area.** If you want to fight a lot of mobs, the best way is usually to build a spawn room rather than to explore the wilderness. And if you do decide to find mobs through exploring at night, they're basically the same difficulty anywhere you go. So, **what mods can you think of that could fix this?** I don't know of any, but I've thought of some ideas that could go into one: * The most basic mod for this would be to make beds prevent mob spawning within a radius of a chunk or two. * A more advanced one would have mob spawn rates slowly scale up with increasing distance from a chunk with a bed that's in a villager house or from the world spawn until they've scaled up or above the vanilla spawn rate. This would allow you to build relatively safe cities anywhere by placing a bed, but have wild lands in-between * Spawn rate could also be tied to y-level with the spawn rate increasing back towards or above normal as you dig down even if there's a bed/city above to simulate the classic dungeon-under-the-city trope in caves. (dungeons would also be a cool thing to spawn under villages in general but that's another mod in itself...) I'm not a great java coder, so there isn't a large chance I'll be able to make this myself. Any devs who find it interesting feel free to steal anything here. **What are your thoughts?** are there mods that already cover most of this? What other mods can you think of that would force the player to travel thousands of blocks from their base to explore or setup additional bases far away from their home?"

0,"I'd love to see another faction that uses power armor, but with a lot more variation",FlamingWings,Fallout,,3,-1,-1,2016-11,11/11/2016 16:41,"Fallout Faction Idea This is going to be kind of long so I will add a TL;DR at the end I'm not even sure if there's going to be a new Fallout game out soon but I recently watched the FudgeMuppet video about the ideal Fallout New Orleans and it really got me thinking. One of the things I loved most about Fallout New Vegas was Caesar's Legion, in my opinion they're one of the coolest factions in the Fallout world so naturally I started to think about what, if any, role they would play in a new Fallout game. I think we can all agree on that the Legion ending from NV most likely won't be the canon ending. In my opinion the Mr. House ending is going to be, which leaves the question: What will happen to the Legion? I think the Legion will collapse, whether Ceasar lives or not won't change that. Without Caesar's leadership smaller fights will erupt amongst their own ranks, most likely resulting in the Legion splitting up into smaller groups. Some maybe going back to the tribes they originally were. If Caesar lives, this may take a bit longer. More important though, there will be people loyal to the old values of Caesar and the Legion. These splinter groups will, in my opinion, most likely be pushed out of old Legion territory, i.e. Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, and further east. Which brings us to the state of Louisiana, and New Orleans (yeah I know Texas lies between New Mexico and Louisiana but ignore that for now. And Caesar's Legion was supposed to be in Texas anyway so we can work something out) So, here's what I'm thinking: Imagine you're exploring the swamps outside of New Orleans when you come upon a town. The town itself is built upon a small lake and held up by stilts which protects it from higher water levels and floods. This town is basically the New Reno of the region. Filled with booze, drugs, stripclubs and prostitutes. You enter the town and eventually end up talking to the mayor, a bartender or whatever. The person will mention something about a raider gang living deep in the swamp outside of the town and you will get a miscellaneous quest to go check it out. When searching for the gang you will travel on a small path through the swamp, when you're getting close to the quest marker a man dressed in rags with a bomb collar around his neck approaches you. He tells you about his ""employers"" and how they have work for you. He assures that you will be greatly rewarded for your services. He then gives you a quest to go and destroy the booze stills, or something in that style, in the New Reno-ish town. After completing the quest you return to the man and he tells you to follow him. The two of you travel down the small path, and coming up at the end of the path is a camp. Outside the walls of the camp there are people crucified, giving you a hint of what's to come. You enter the camp and is greeted by a person wearing weathered legionary armor. He welcomes you to the camp of The Cohort (or The Zealot's, Zealot's of Caesar or something like that, going to be calling them The Cohort for now) and gives you the story of the Legion, and a recap of what has happened since the second battle of Hoover Dam. This person won't be the leader of the faction but merely one in their ranks. He then proceeds to offer you a place in the group, maybe sending you out on a new quest to prove your worth. You continue to work for The Cohort and learn more about them. I want this really powerfull and mysterious character to lead them, sort of a Lanius figure, brutal but more charismatic. He must have other interests besides destruction. As you progress through the questline you eventually get called up to a meeting with this leader. He praises you for the work you have done and tells you that The Cohort has great plans for the wastes of New Orleans. He tells you about the second coming of The Legion, how you and the rest of his men will unite the tribes and towns of the region and eventually march on New Orleans, claiming it for The Legion. The whole idea of The Cohort is to give the player the choice to revive the dying Legion and finally giving it the Rome it deserves. I want them to have very similar values to those of the Legion, such as prohibiting the use of alcohol and drugs, using slaves and having a totalitarian dictator as a leader. They will also use the same roman hierarchy. I have more ideas but I feel that this is enough for now. Let me know what you think and if you want more. Also feel free to comment if you have any ideas to improve on mine! TL;DR I have this idea of a faction that will originate from Caesar's Legion from Fallout New Vegas that I would love to appear in a new Fallout game. Essentially you would be able to give The Legion its rebirth and unite the wastes of New Oreleans/Louisiana, or wherever the game takes place, under its flag."

Less grind = more fun for everyone. Without factories on Civ - you couldn't do much at all. Here, you can thrive with or without them. No, I don't hate Civcraft because I do play fairly often and I've made quite the bunch of friends there. I've seen development yet it was very slow. But this ain't no complainin post about Civ. This is my post about appreciating devoted for what it is. So even though I just started devoted and I knew right from the start when 3.0 of devoted launched that the experience would be amazing and I wasn't dissapointed. This server is great. To the staff: keep up the hard work! If you agree with me, leave an upvote or reply with your thoughts on Devoted! Thanks for your time. Stay dank. -tnug out."

Rotations are seemingly pulled out of a hat, guys are playing 14 straight minutes then sitting entire halves, our efficient players barely touch the ball while inefficient guys iso and chuck, we lose any semblance of an offensive system late in games, we turn the ball over like crazy, and our defense sucks. I know we're young. I know it's a long season. But nothing about the way the Denver Nuggets have played this year has inspired any confidence in Michael Malone's ability to gameplan, distribute minutes, or adjust on the fly.

Ipsut Creek is a great place to camp, because although its technically a back country camp, it used to be a car camp.

It's possible since the full size is just $12.50, but something tells me it's just the deluxe sample. In any case, the overall value of the box has so far been well above and beyond what I've paid for it. The eye cream sample I got last month was worth nearly $20, with an overall retail value for the box being at around $40. This month will likely be a dud for me due to me not being able to use the cream, but it's a first. I figure I'll come across a dud every now and again, so I keep a three strikes rule on cancelling."

Things like EZ and calling people noobs after a close game or heated toxic shouting matches over the voip and chat were not as present in my opinion. For example, I even got shouted at over voip and kicked from the squad because I went for a bayonet change and when asked for the reason he told me I was a killwhore...and went on for three games to annoy me in chat. Maybe I am just imagining things, or maybe I am getting old. I played LoL and Mw3 for a long time, so I am quite familiar with toxicity. However, I just think it hits me more because Battlefield is truly a series close to my heart and hate to see the toxicity coming to the series. Can't remember it during the years of Battlefield."

Hi everyone, Just as hopefully everyone else on this sub, I love this game. But I've been having some difficulties, and I'll list them off in hope that some of you can help me out... 1. Houses. In my recent game I've had a terrible starvation where 90% of my population died off. As a result, my survivors were scattered across the map. So I closed buildings in favour of bunching my people up to close walking distance. So now all my people are living in different houses close together, so instead of at least adults coupling up everyone decided they needed their own house. So now, firewood was being used at an insane rate to heat all these barely populated homes. Do I have to demolish every single house to prevent this? A feature to 'close' houses would be perfect to prevent this perhaps. 2. Maps. As a noob player I find it frustrating to get maps that are littered with hills and lakes. Perhaps it's like that to make the game more challenging but can we have some maps that are flatter (noob friendlier...) that don't force me to stretch my town across thin valleys and make forester lodges a pain in the ass to place. I know there are mods for this but vanilla features for this would be wonderful! P.S. How does everyone manage to feed their town past the 150 population point? Nothing seems to help for me."

I have seen a fair share of crazy liberal feminists who believe that women are entitled to everything because they are women, but I have also met plenty more women who work their ass off and achieve everything quite fairly. Now, the minority of women who support the *my choice* abortion are those who are, quite frankly, crazy. Again, those are the 'fringe' parts of liberalism. Classical liberalism is nothing like that. They believe in both rights *and* responsibilities. I am not even a liberal, I am a conservative and so I feel that all men and women should be free to do as they please with their body. The concept of body autonomy is essential to the functioning of human rights. If we do not have body autonomy then everything else falls apart and we certainly should not have the expectation that everyone will defend their freedom with the barrel of a gun because that's not how one should defend their freedom, unless absolutely necessary. Anyway, I think I am digressing a little. Don't use an internet forum as a barometer for what women think, especially two chromosomes. That place is an effective safe space, much like coontown or fatpeoplehate used to be. Plus, a lot of women think that 'being a man' is about acting like a dick and, so, a lot of young feministas basically act like that to try look 'hard and cool', like teenage boys.

About 2 months later he had a candle burning in his room with the window open. The wind blew a sombrero off the wall and onto the candle. It caught some clothing and part of the bed and the room started to go. It triggered the smoke alarm and I was able to get to it with an extinguisher before the room was fully involved. If that had happened and we didn't have batteries in that smoke alarm, the entire building would have been a loss. The best part? He was pissed at me for getting ""fire extinguisher dust"" all over his room. Ironically, he was kicked out because he caused flood damage a few months later."

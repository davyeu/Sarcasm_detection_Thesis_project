I mean, I know it's a game and all, but Atlus specifically focuses on the making the Persona games leave an impact on the player. I, for one, can say that after a full 120+ hour playthrough of the game, I feel a lot different than when I first loaded up the game. The game really made me realize how much people will want to take advantage of you and use you any chance they get, but that by believing in yourself and in those you trust you can reject what is thought of as ""normal"" or ""right"" and do what you believe in. Even though some may think that what you do is abnormal or unusual, what matters the most is that you have confidence in yourself and in what you are doing. I've really gained a lot of self-confidence after playing this amazing game as well as become more aware of the things I feel are wrong in society around me. I know it's rather unusual, but does anyone else feel a similar way?"

I got violently raped exactly a year ago today by a cop that I was dating up there. They did a sting phone call, they had emails where he admitted what he did and questioned his intent. Trooper handling my case was sure he'd proven intent. I remember on the sting phone call when he got all excited and said based on what he said, we could prove intent... Charges were never brought by the special prosecutor. The state refuses to pay my medical bills or counseling. 40% of women in Alaska report being sexually assaulted at some point when surveyed, which is double the national average. It's the most beautiful place I've ever been. I've never been happier than when I was there. And I've never been more scared or had my soul squashed harder than when I was there. I'm finally over the PTSD for the most part and am able to make plans with my life without feeling like there's a shadow over them. But he still gets to work as a cop in Alaska if he wants.

1,Why would I want wards when I can double kill bot lane as support Lux,final_spork_gg,leagueoflegends,,1,-1,-1,2016-12,27/12/2016 20:31,"What if upgrading sightstone opens up a special slot for control ward Sometimes when i play support and the games drag out to a long period of time, both teams have max items except for the support, who has to empty out a slot for the control ward, and usually gets smashed by enemy adc due to lack of an extra tank item. Some may argue not getting an control ward solves the problem easily, but for a support wards are their only pride they leave on the map as dominance. Which is why i thought, why not giving a sightstone upgrade that grants the player an extra slot **ONLY** for control ward. Or better, a *refillable* control ward. (Might prove^too^overpowered?) I feel that this gives the sightstone a sense of uniqueness with the addition of an upgrade, since sightstone=refillable wards; and sightstone+ = control ward slot (or refillable control wards). Just my thoughts on making a support life easier, helping to get rid of the frustration of a support to keep a empty slot when everyone is full items, and you're just gonna get chunked out while peeling for your adc. Cheers!"

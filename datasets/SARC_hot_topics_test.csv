Trooper handling my case was sure he'd proven intent. I remember on the sting phone call when he got all excited and said based on what he said, we could prove intent... Charges were never brought by the special prosecutor. The state refuses to pay my medical bills or counseling. 40% of women in Alaska report being sexually assaulted at some point when surveyed, which is double the national average. It's the most beautiful place I've ever been. I've never been happier than when I was there. And I've never been more scared or had my soul squashed harder than when I was there. I'm finally over the PTSD for the most part and am able to make plans with my life without feeling like there's a shadow over them. But he still gets to work as a cop in Alaska if he wants.

Even though some may think that what you do is abnormal or unusual, what matters the most is that you have confidence in yourself and in what you are doing.

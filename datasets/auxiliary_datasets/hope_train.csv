“That would be just pure mean” aw love this kiddo she made my day <3,0
The future is Africans shoving down a bitter pill of change in the dry throat of white supremacies that have refused to learn from the past it created,0
EliasTTA She’s literally wrong .... her idea that homosexuality is something she’s against is literally discriminatory,0
She is so PATHETIC!,0
Kids meet marina Taylor please please please please please please,0
Thats right all lives do matter period and if you think that it's not then shame on you ALL LIFE MATTERS PERIOD!!!!!! ONE LOVE TO ALL HUMANS,1
@Michael Paysour wow thats rude,0
@Dus Bus Still this slogan sound rasist. No one cares what do you have on your mind by saying this. The main thing how does it sounds. What if I gonna stand in front of group of black people somewhere in dark street and start to shout out loud white lives matters. More likely I gonna be killed.,0
The current and former representatives of my home state of Arizona are always painting an ugly picture to the rest of the country. It's a shame.,0
A movement to fight racism,0
BBC Censored and clearly you don’t understand the struggle of other community’s,0
Sourav Kumar RoyChowdhury Comunism is a joke,0
@Tyrone Marcus I'm sorry you're so brainwashed and threatened by people whose lives have absolutely no affect on your own. Mind your business and stop worrying about how other people live. If anything is of the devil it's hatred and you're full of it.,0
The girl who said she doesnt agree with homosexuality is a lesbian  Look at her and tell me she doesnt look like a 12 year old boy,0
Truly said.. That what I was waiting for. To let the world realize about girls and engineering.,1
Annie. You’re closeted. It’s ok I’ve been there. We’re here for you when you’re ready.,0
Right in the feels,0
@Maggie Paul my heart is not full hatred ibam not a racist person I am black my self the naacp is honestly not need anymore it ain't the Jim crow era black were truly oppressed black peot are not the only racial or ethnic group that experience d disadvantages  all live matter want to figh for that basic human right that no human being should experience racism and discrimination or should be killed for who the r we come together as humans and fight for all human being who suffered from these issues not juts black people.,1

Your family sounds amazing! I hope your dreams come true!,1
Big Pete historical revisionism.,0

I agree with you you could have not said it any better,0
Just saying this,0
The most important thing in the bible is to love,1
@Aaliyah Yusuf Have you ever heard about South Africa?,0
It’s honestly not even a battle between white vs black people. It’s a battle between racists and people.,1
All lives matter!! What is this? Lol,0
@James Johnson HAHA good mangina comeback. women got banned from getting education.... so were most men. What's your point? And why do you talk about history? We live at this moment. Women are the majority of degree receipients in Associates,1
@SamAnimations! a bit too optimistic let's say 1/2,0
K A mabey but  being stereotypical is kinda bad,0
Yes plastic surgery,0
My family and I bought two of the Goldieblox books for my niece as a birthday present. When we opened them up and began reading her the stories and helping / showing her how to build things with the construction toys,0
@Beautiful World I was born and raised in the USA.  I honor and respect it.  I have heard how it is like in other countries.  People come here for a reason and then they try to change it.  I don't understand it.  If you don't like it here.  Please go back to where you came from.  I mean this in a kind way.,0
I love how these kids,0
black lives only matter on election years. Remember that,0
@Alexander Schüler Why not include everyone?Isnt ONLY saying black lives matter only including 1 race,0
Why did god make homosexuality uncontrollable?,0
+DawnOfTheDead991 In fact yes I am okay with that cause right now we got Neo Confederate shitstains dividing this Nation with hate and ignorance.  And Police who are completely unaccountable for their actions.  Go save the whales all you want hipster.  I'm more concerned with my fellow American Citizens,0
@connie schuiling I suggest you stop making things up.,0
Jesus Christ Donnie Inzodda your commenting way too much,0
Ya'll are saying God wants us to love everyone. Get the love that God wants you to use straight. Different types of love are used. Loving someone with the same gender isn't love but lust.,0
ALL LIVES MATTER! If you feel as if you deserve more well get up off your b---! Put your guns down stop killing and robbing,1
Is she a bullfighter?,0
There's always a way out and Madonna is just changing the world for the better!,1
Blm thinks that black live matter more than everyone else's,0
@River Rower how?  She actually revolutionized music.  So I don't get why you are here?  If you don't like her than fine.  We all have a right to our own opinion.  But I just don't get people who watch interviews with celebrities on the net when it is clear they don't like them?  Why watch someone if you really don't want to?  I mean no one is forcing you to watch this.🤔,0
All lives matter even little.  EVEN LITTLE ABORTED BABIES THAT HAVE BEEN KIILLED ALL LIVES MATTER EVEN THE BABIES AN CHILDERN WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THEIR PARTENTS AN CHILD MOSLESTERS AN SO ON .  ALL LIVES MATTER TO GOD TOO AN THAT MEANS ALL LIVES,1
It should be all lives matter,1
It istn about,0
Ben Lambe it does exist. I’m going to assume you’re white but please correct me if I’m wrong. So let’s say you’re white,0
Saying All lives matter can be offensive for the same reason black lives matter can be offensive to some. Black Lives Matter is an offensive saying because to some  it insinuates that the majority of non blacks think that black lives don't matter and that the majority of non blacks are racist when there is absolutely no physical evidence to support that thought. So obviously to a non racist non black that is a grossly offensive notion. Now All Lives Matter can be offensive to some blacks because to them it insinuates that they only care about black lives and that they're saying other lives don't matter when if you actually try comprehend their perspective,1
ah wired. i had just subscribed to you yesterday and now I have to unsubscribe.,0
Guaranteed by law freedom,1
@James Johnson Sorry. Even though I agree with you,0
fresh air matters. you can't live without air,0
All lives matter not just black lives if wight peopol said wihgt lives matter we would be racict,0
And Aushwitz then...?Go figure.,0
@Gameplay Central No thank you.,0
A lot of our children are addicted. Meth floods the streets the dealers give it out for free like candy too get addiction started plus they dust fentanyl on pot sales to get them addicted this is driving crime. We need help all of us! We have to get drugs off the street and get help to addicts. Please let's work together!,1
@The Savage Taxman Funny that you say that,0
LETS TURN WIRED INTO A POLITICAL PROPAGANDA-CHANNEL,0
We should topple Cromwell's statue as well. He oppressed and butchered thousands of Irish people.,0
I'm 14 and in our school we have a STEM program the fact that I'm a girl never discouraged me from applying. But I know that it discourages other girls as there are 22 kids in the program and only 6 of us are girls.,1
Posted 4 years ago and still relevant today  same event same narrative happens every 4 years.,0
She just had an emotional speech. This video was made directly after. She had been crying you know? Her speech made me cry. Listen to it.. the full speech !,0
something is wrong with her,0
@MfZ homosexuality has been documented to a part of human civilization going back thousands of years and our species has yet to collapse. im sure the statistically small number of lgbt in the world wont bring things to a halt.,0
owen eiffel Jesus said to love everyone no matter what.,1
@Idk Nan Molla But like you said it's the majority,0
@WindTheBrave I think i wrote this on the wrong comment. I understand what he meant and i agree lol,0
I am so glad that you made your toy!!! I wouldn't have extended my love for science!!! I feel like I don't fit in at school sometimes,1
Came out and fought back because of her. New and ungrateful generation has no clue what she has done for us.,1
Black lives matter is about TOLERANCE.  All lives matter is about UNITY.,0
Your thinking is right and great.,1
I played with Lego and blocks as well as dolls when I was younger. I played with you cars,1
BLM Toronto was invited to be the honored group at the parade. They chose to show up and protest it before they got on their own float and waved at people.  This is after the protested another LGBT event last week. nnCanada more than bends over backwards for people. The more they do it the more people demand of it.,0
Show me the verse.,0
It only matters when it's sexism directed towards men am I right?,0
they are rioters,0
Absolutely agree. BLM is racist.,0
This video really inspired me. I'm a computer science major and I've been in the same boat my whole life. I loved Legos as a kid but people around me really pushed gender roles,1
Juan needs to shut up. Why is he still on Fox. Sheriff Clark is awesome,0
4 years later this is still going on.  They wont show videos of cops killing anyone but black people. The media should be held accountable for all of this.,0
No they werent. And even if they were,0
Beatiful!!! It was inspiring for me,1
And the media. They are all truly responsible for the racial divide in America..,0
Jesuschrist live matters.he is under Attack from EVIL forces.!!!!,0
This president is doing stuff to help the black community.  Stop murdering long enough to listen to how he wants to help.,0
My dad ALWAYS included me on all his manly things growing up. He is my biggest supporter in pursuing my mechanical engineering degree. I started working in the industrial manufacturing industry and fell in love.,1
not butt of the day.( Ass of the day ),0
Then what are we all arguing about?nBINGO.,0
I love being pro white,0
Why not all lives matter. Does it mean Asians have to die and no one will care. Of course all lives matter.,0
64R1M nespecially bcoz of blm movement,0
All live matter obviously and that Term was set up and put out knowing the racial tension it would cause. George soros was sure of that why he funded the movement from the beginning. Its a game of the people with agendas not necessarily caring about black lives/ police brutality,0
I like her creation! Keep dreaming girl!!,1
If you believe in God and the sacrifice that was the only begotten son to be sacrificed for all of HUMANITY! nnAll lives DO MATTER! nnWhat BLM is trying to institute is; the same horrible generalization that befell the entirety of the Germanic nation,1
Is conversion therapy illegal because it often times involves physical and mental abuse or do people just ignore that?,1
@UddinNo1 hopefully it'll be Karl Marx statue,0
@Will Weathers All lives WILL matter when black lives matter.,0
Back in the old days there were no pink and blue aisles. In the 80s in my country there were few toys to choose from so the parents got what they could. Me and my sisters had a bucket full of building blocks a would play a lot creating adventures and stuff. I didn't like dolls or barbies because the joints could not be bent. We also borrowed our father's saw and files and we created stuff from twigs. Having less plastic premade stuff made us more creative,1
Creative- Maybe blacks stars exist? You don't know. We think that dark matter and black holes exist. So.................you got that going for you.,0
Stale Chip I think there’s a difference between loving a person and supporting an act. I don’t agree with homosexuality,0
This was such a heartfelt Ted talk & really hit home for me as an industrial engineer in my senior year. Especially personally this week because I have dealt my whole college life with doubters and disbelievers in my intelligence and diligence & to realize I'm not alone in feeling alone was very awakening and motivating. I'm so inspired to inspire young females to dare to challenge societal pressures and expectations and open the minds of the close minded. An engineer once asked me what it was like to be in a mans world and I replied with I'm used to it and it's not a mans world,1
Ok so before I write this comment I want to state I’m NOT RACIST and I heavily support #blacklivesmatter but this one thing needs to be addressed,0
Black are actually a privileged race. As far as I know they have more chances to best universities even though they are only 13% of the population. If America practise the equality as what Dems claims,0
what a load of bollocks,0
Why was he even still up?,0
I'm a teenage girl who wants to become an engineer. I was talking to a friend recently about why he decided that engineering wasn't for him,1
Big story erases messages by the way.,0
@Ikaika Corpus That's good. Still along way to go though.,1
Does the short haired girl have like insta or something,0
ALM - All Lives Matter,1
None of our life's matter to them.  What matters to them is keeping us divided.,0
Jimmy Pop don’t be stupid.,0
My thoughts exactly. Style is style though,0
If you say All Lives Matter,0
It's just sad that while we're growing up,0
Finally new butt of the day,0
@Baden Jones not true. There's a red talk about it actually and there's research (which produced results) about why it might happen,0
@Vanesa Second wave will happen nonetheless,0
BLM Too your life matters to me. I’m white,0
Engineering drawing has me that way too,1
For sure. i can almost guarantee this year will be taught in history classes,0
I love all people regardless of race,1
Blue Lives Matter. Black Lives Matter. Hispanic Lives Matter. Asian Lives Matter. White Lives Matter. ETC.....All Lives Matter! Defend the Police. Reduce crime. Stop resisting arrest. Stop talking back. Obey the Law. Respect the Police and anyone in Authority. Simple Rule. Criminals are like Children. You need to punish bad behaviors. Law and Order and Justice=A Civilized Society.,1
Humans coming together as one is MUCH STRONGER.,0
My parents did way better under trumps administration than Obamas,0
White people building themselves the best countries and societies in the world isn't white supremacy just because those societies were designed to benefit white people. Otherwise what is China? Yellow supremacy?,0
They tore down the statue of Saddam Hussein. Everybody thought that was the Beginning of a beautiful Iraq. Well?,0
It does but In this current day and society it seems that black lives are targeted the most,0
When people say all lives matters its derogatory to the black lives movement this movement stand for the political injustice that black people face just walking down the streets dresses in a suspicious manner. So when you say all lives matter you make it as though all lives face this same issue. Naturally all lives matter is that even a question. But the problem here is when you say all lives matter you indirectly denounce the problems faced by victims of racist police brutality by also indirectly implying that all lives face this problem,0
It’s actually none of your business.,0
The most beautiful eyes.,0
So depressing how the more rational and intellectually honest you are the more you are vilified and ostracized. Unless good men like Larry Elder and Sheriff Clark are joined by the silent majority we are doomed as a nation,0
from djibouti that was great but you had courage to achieve your aim,1
Why do I get the feeling that I am gonna find anti-religious comments? This video is just asking for toxicity.,0
Obviously you lead a boring life if you're here watching this video and you find it boring. I mean,0
The cost looks similar to something Michael Jackson wore,0
I'm studying to be a civil engineer..hope I succeed,1
Can you believe it?,0
I honestly had no idea,0
How can Black People endorse the the Democratic Party?  The Democratic Party has Oppressed and Enslaved Black People for Hundreds of years!,0
PATTYY L she is,0
Started crying early on and never stopped,0
@thomas rawls I have you idiot and you do not understand stats as it's predominantly a white country you moron. Go and look up the actual STATS that are freely available before you open your ignorant mouth.,0
My high school guidance counselor also suggested that I go into engineering,0
Democrats are behind it they fear loosing the black vote so much they create  issues to keep  black peoples voting for them.,0

Larry elder he the man God bless him,0
Clinically Happy it’s class not race. Do you think if George Floyd was a middle or upper class black American,0
Larry is fired up...I love this guy!,0
@Jojo Mortos yes African Americans are systematically oppressed by white Supremecy. The racist affair that is currently taking place is systematic bc the minorities which are ppl of color have no power to oppress their white superiors... But discrimination is more complex than that.nn Just like colourism,0
@EseKanayo2 threatend by who exactly?the black community suffers from mostly black on black crimes yet there's no riots about that.,0
America is the funniest thing ever existed,0
@Morso NTohvelit yes,0
Omg. Were at the exactly same state . I hope we'll get through this.,1
It is in New York know I think,0
madonna your the best!,0
@End the EU - end the Fourth ReichnOr this,0
That made me cry so hard,0
Jimmy Claypool All lives do matter and that’s not racist but in you got a point people will use all lives matter to be racist. Freedom of speech is complicated because those words are just like an illusion because the founder of America use those terms to feel free,0
I would like the kids to meet people of all LGBT+ identities. It’s be really good for them to meet Aro and Ace people.,1
Floyd was a criminal,0
Y’all need to listen to this,0
Carlos Lau M. how can you honestly say that?,0
pvz68man There is absolutely nothing wrong with LGBTQIA+ You seriously need to stfu. Because I don’t give af what a book says love is love and I don’t see how other people’s sexuality affects you. You are a small person,1

@Jan Bittner why are you so salty Jan?,0
That much surgery to her face i hardly recognise her,0
Saying alm gaslights and undermines blm. No one is saying other lives do not matter they are simply saying black lives matter too.,0
Why is it that every 4 years this come up democrats are scum,0
crystal's outfit tho! lookin' good girl,0
It feels right to me. The statue should have been removed.,0
I'd say the same... but I'm in Zimbabwe. Not even our president wants to be in Zim! lol (please get me out of here),0
Jessica Walker that’s not what she meant.... she’s not wrong,0
Of course it's matters that all of the people have access to  apples,0
@elvis ricardo white people get killed more by police than black people. Black people aren't a majority at all,0
To answer the title of this video,0
slideshowgurl just because someone looks a certain way doesn’t mean their queer.. I’m a straight female but I love to have short hair.,0
i mean we arent generally praising them for the having slave thing. yknow?,0
Police brutality # this officer still an LAPD cops.violent continue. Share.,0
At first i thought that anna chick was cute and was gonna be nice and accepting but i was wrong,0
BLM is Marxist division- plane and simple. All Lives Matter is unity. United we stand as American's,0
The suit tells who you are.,0

@Dave S the payscale is based on certifications,0
My god i love crystal so much,0
That little boy w/ the grey shirt spoke big fax,0
Apparently no. They for if it!,0
Tapiokapuddin It just means that you don’t consider it okay but you don’t care if others do and you still accept and respect them. It’s kind of like saying you don’t agree with like a politician and what they stand for or something but you don’t hate or frown upon anyone who does. That’s all.,1
When my mom suggested to me to become a civil engineer I pictured myself this strong smart woman in suits designing beautiful constructions visiting the site and giving instructions to the workers. It sounded pretty amazing as a girl who will be doing such things. And right now I'm on the path to become an engineer but sometimes I really do feel lonely and discouraged though. These kind of talks really inspire and sharpen me a lot! Thank you so much. And what you are doing right now is so great Debbie!,1
@S. Tagerius I was really impressed with your ability to communicate the horrific implications of conversion therapy and support of the LGBT+ community.. but completely shocked and disappointed that you are advocating that abortion is killing a baby. Why is it that you think LGBT+ individuals are worthy of bodily autonomy but women aren't worthy of having autonomy over their bodies??,1
This was extremely inspiring,1
@seinfan9nYou are incorrect on all accounts. Women are not over-represented. She even stated that only 11% of the engineering workforce are female. How is that number over-represented? Only 20% graduate with the degree (only 20% even go into the field). Let's see,1
Dan Daves What’s “fact” is the absolute truth of God’s word,0
I completely understand you. This Mexican girl will keep working towards her goals though.,1
@christo 04002283nnCoronavirus would like to know your location.,0
@Ashrenneemakeup And it's insulting enough to other ethnic groups that many make it a point to actively combat the movement. If it was Black lives matter too,0
@1990m t rich history?nA history the Taliban couldn't GAF about?nYeah,0
The line “Man shall not lay with man” was incorrect. It was originally “Man shall not lay with boy”.,0
Noelle Kay Saying you don’t agree with something doesn’t mean you hate it.,0
@HermesLVDiva1976 you're dumbed down 100%,0
So true I was discouraged by men too. They arent willing to help and pick on you for not knowing stuff that they learnt by communicating with their friends.,1
The main cause of racism is the mentality of people,1
@MrCosmin94 There is a spirit world and I make the choice to stand with God.,0
​@Everything EVERYTHING!! Ironic how black people had encouraged the slave trade during it's golden ages. We will tear down Nelson Mandela's statue next if Churchill's statue is teared down as he was a communist terrorist supporting a banned African political movement. the blm have just become a fascist group at this point.,0
No their isn't Juan. Come on get real,0
You are going to hell,0
Your ancestors were thugs.,0
All life matter. That simple,1
yeah man. He looks like a wartime general who could bomb an opposing country back to the stone ages.,0
@QueenOfIndians She's always done what is daring or pushing boundaries. Any negative publicity she's every gotten has only increased her celebrity. Evidence,1

Brilliant inteview.. Madonna was very sincere almost emotional.. Good job by the interviewer.,0

Why should it be illegal?,0
Corvus Corax that's great! Many girls have been teased for having interest in STEM. I am only 26 and when I was in grade school,1
It’s really stupid... my friend’s parents threatened her with conversion therapy.. her dad is a pastor and found out 2 weeks ago..,1
Unfortunately todays society is that confused,0
I’m not even gonna bother arguing cause I’ve done this all day and you people don’t learn,0
Love it! Thank You!!!,0
Sigh... So you are the problem then?,0
Why doesn't anyone talk about many more WHITE people killed by police than BLACK people!!!,0
She looks so beautiful,0
If anyone boos/feels offended when someone says Black lives matter.nnnThey are racists. Period.,0

Madonna is a queen. Awesome too,0
Nathanael Wade When did we ever say that? Anyone can be racist. People like you love to make excuses for George Floyd’s,0
Shrödinger Kat well that’s just absurd because God created all human beings all different colours and shapes and sizes,1
Just because he did that doesn’t mean he can get killed,0
see what is the live matter?n,0
I have always loved her and her soul. Madonna you are amazingly inspirational.,1
Someone beats my kid with a book,0
People really start to suck as they grow up. The younger kids were so sweet and accepting as opposed to the older girl who's clearly in a denial mode. About herself.,1
@Vernice Davis The BLM is simply related to politics. There is a website where you can donate to BLM,0
I grew up being taught to not make fun of any group you're not a part of. Except queer.nMy sister is lesbian,1

Yeah I cried through the entire video,0
Isnt it amazing this is happening in the cities where there are university's... bored students in lockdown. They have no idea of the hate amd the retribution this is going to make. There is  66 million people in britain..and they have managed to upset everyone from the damage,0
please hug that little girl 🥺🥺,1
IKR I don’t know why these people are doing this. They’re forgetting the virus.,0
GOD GAVE ME THE CHOICE TO LOVE A child is teaching us.,1
ur standard of hottest is laughable,0
The video says kids meet...but it always feels like I'm meeting a new and a unique person..,1
Keep up the good work Debbie. I always like to work with female engineers,1
@A G I understand that but I wasnt suggesting All lives matter should be the response and thats it what I am suggesting is booing all lives matter is racist and we need to recognise that or though BLM is a great thing we have to be careful not yo cause more racism and division as whatever the corr message is people take things and run with it using good things to hurt good people,1
@BJGvideos Your premise is a failure.  There is a clear difference between 'various aspects of the world' and adult subject matter.  Healthy,0
@blazekilla555 But I don't think everyone uses it in that way they're trying to say ALL lives matter meaning equality and it's nothing to do with BLM or against it it's just stand for human equality and lives,0
All this will do is push people towards the right and grow hatred towards the minority groups.,0
Sisu Guillam I know right,0
Can't wait for Karl Marx to come down next,0
BLM has been politicised and is now controlled by hard left white anarchists and supported by fools that don't realise that.,0

I don't know why i cried after watching this. Maybe because i feel what she felt during the times she almost give up because  of the peer pressure and perspective of other people. But i kept saying to myself that i am worthy of being successful engineer. Truly this makes me more appreciate what girls can do.,1
@Shannen_xo Whatever makes you happy crISps,0
That quote is so lovely,0
I am anxious to see if my 10 year old daughter will watch this with me! STEM toys are her favorite,1
I don’t think homosexuality is something you can or cannot agree with. It’s like saying “I don’t agree with oxygen”. It’s just a thing that exists in the world. You can’t deny it or get rid of it. It’s not good or bad,1
I don't give scrap who hate for me .... ALL LIVES MATTER regardless of race,1
We're all pink on the inside.,0
no you should rather  make the liberals happy by giving them what they want,0
With so many people thinking that they are God's. If that were true than why don't they see that God looks at everyone with pure love and he filled our world with wonders that all people need to experience like the healing power's of all he created. If all lives matter than we will all prosper as it should be. When only one race matters it is doomed to fail because to actually be a true success all lives unite to combat what's wrong.,1
This video really made me cry.,0
If you cant keep your own in-house clean,0
She looks vulnerable or is that more concious?,0
All lives matter! Stop dividing people by skin color!,1
WHAT ABOUT NATIVE AMERICAN LIVES??? THEY ARE NOT EVEN MENTIONED???? AND THEY WERE HERE FIRST!! BEFORE BLACK,0
@Damian Vigorito and I bet you believe the Earth is flat too. Gonna vote for Trump again in 2020? Loser,0
These people do not even know who this guy was!!!,0
@JDOT 88 no one should vandalise a  statue by a movement that has no aim and no end they have lost their way and Will begin to  distroy the country.,0
And yet this all started because of a game of legal chess. George floyd is the whole reason why BLM came out  and yet he's long been forgotten with all the chaos and destruction those same people has caused. In the end they only care about skin color. nRIP Tony Timpa.,0
In Bristol museum and art gallery there's some assyrian reliefs. Next to them there is a display explaining how in Iraq ISIS destroyed historical monuments for not being in line with their beliefs.,0
I say well done! Slave traders dont deserve to be standing in the middle of the street and promoting the symbol of hate.,0
@Holden Stegall in America??!!! I thout it was illegal,0
hans kasper No one ever said white lives doesn’t matter. Why don’t white Americans start their own protest instead of trying to forcefully join and switch the agenda. In no way is it a double standard,0
Stephen Roche. if that's what you can take from this you're pretty pathetic.,0
Racism at it's best,0
DailyUpdate no but still social distancing and wearing mask should be practiced while protesting. That’s all I am asking. I know time is the essence and now is the time to stand up and protest to try and change racism. But pls everyone stay safe,1
RIP Edward Colston - HERO.  A good philanthropist and merchant in a time much harder than today.,0
All lives matter not stop being racist in this country.,1
@Jimmy Pop  Yeah I get what you're saying. There's some things I just can't get past. I honestly feel these last two album(s) she's made have been extremely dark. There's things that I've picked up where my conscious tells me 'that doesn't sound or look right.' You know? I often ask myself when listening to one her songs,0

These protesters have completely disregarded the feelings of the majority of the people who don’t want the statue to be removed. And when these people actually did take it down they end up throwing it in the river! Like that is the example a modern society is supposed to be taking when we are all meant to be more environmentally conscious about dumping. I hope they are able to fish it out of the river,1

This conversion-therapy is pure nonsense and is the most ridiculous and damaging trash I have ever heard of in the 21st century ! It is all too often religiously-fueled poison and can never work.

@Floris You pathetic,0
The Black community by saying Black Lives Matter exhibits that they are Racists because all lives are created by the same GOD so there should be no diff. I fully support the call  All Lives Matter Hannity you are absolutely right in your argument. ALL LIVES MATTER and those shouting Black lives matter should be arrested because they are inciting Racial disparities without doubt,0

Didn’t even watch the vid but I’ll tell you why it’s controversial to say ‘all lives matter’.nIt’s because racism is a tool used by the elite to divide the population.nSo they want the divide and this BLM group helps that divisive agenda.nOf course all lives matter,0

@GamerXP3 the minute you mention white privilege is the minute your credibility dies. That's an ad hominem attack to demean white people and make our accomplishments essentially worthless. It's an excuse. A fallacy. The black community won't change until they take responsibility for their own actions. The community wont change until they stop blaming white people for all of their problems. I don't want to hear about privilege coming from minorities considering they get to live illegally here and get hand outs because they don't want to work. It's a logical fallacy.,0

Nobody was saying “All Lives Matter” until “Black Lives Matter”. It’s protest against a protest.,0

BLM no longer wants body cameras on police.  Watch a few bodycam police videos and you’ll understand why.  Video after video proves that many of these claims of police brutality are complete bullshit or they are edited without context to spread the anti police narrative by unscrupulous “ social media influencers”. All this does is make it more difficult for the good police who are protecting our streets and people who actually are victims of excessive force.,0

There is nothing wrong with saying All Lives Matter.  nnHowever there is absolutely something very wrong with saying All lives Matter while at the exact same time standing against some lives. nnAll lives matter is the epitome of the serpent tongue language.nnThe same kind of language that was used when the constitution was written.nnWe believe in liberty and justice for All... while at the same time owning slaves.nnSaying one thing... while doing the other. nnIf people really thought All lives matter then they would stand together with Black lives Matter and support stopping Police brutality. Stopping police brutality is the goal and would help All lives because police brutality would stop for everyone.nnBut are they doing that? nNo?nThen how can they care about all lives? nnForked tounge language.nnWe're not fooled.nnBeware the serpent tongue.,0

I dont understand why it is up to anyone else but yourself to make the decision to become an engineer or whatever. The great thing about america or any other nation that is similar is that if you work hard you can accomplish pretty much anything you set your mind to.

That's horrible and inexcusable to do to another human being even more so a child!

There are countless countries where it's punishable by prison or death.nThere's a fine line between being a professional victim and sticking your head in the sand and pretending all the bad things are over now. Although I know that's what a lot of people want to do. The gays got that one thing,0

@Dangus Do you not for once not think police fear for their lives around Black people who statistically have the highest crime rates? Killing others and not only their race? Why do you think they are so trigger-happy? Sorry,0

Most of the time I’d like to believe there is some form of middle ground to be found.

ALL LIVE MATTER. All controversy over this is caused by racist bigots. Black lives mater is a racist statement and supports segregation. Black lives matter supports black supremacy just as KKK supports white supremacy.  Black lives matter and KKK ate both equally racist. Plain and simple.,1

Where are all the video of the burnt and looted family businesses and all the pictures of the people that have been murdered during these protests? Or do only certain black lives that have certain political beliefs matter? And before you say well not all the protesters are like that,0
Women have equal opportunity to succeed at STEM related fields in fact with a graduation rate much higher than men,1

I was just accepted into Purdue University's engineering school and I'm so excited! I never had any interest in engineering until I took a physics class and fell in love. Being a massive creative person this is such a relief. Knowing I don't have to give that up to be an engineer. You are such a massive inspiration! Thank you so much,1
I know right lmao,0
That's really cool..but things are rather different in India...u pursued engineering because u wanted to and it's very very very surprising for me that your mom reacted in the way she did when you told her that you wanted to be an engineer..and here my parents want me to become one no matter what....they just want me to do that 4 year course and after that I can do whatever I want to...strange right????,0

Thank you! So true! The church has done SO many awful things in God's name and been a terrible reflection of Christ. Praying the church can wake up and repent of its past and present sins. I don't blame people for wanting to stay far from Christianity. It just breaks my heart since I know the way many Christians act is so contrary to the way Jesus called us to live. He loved sinners,1
It’s called conversion “therapy” being being beaten by a book is very therapeutic??,0

Hey this kind of stuff matters no matter who it happens to! It's wrong to happen to anyone! This happens to white people every day! When it does? Well it's not discrimination or wrong because your white!

Its alot of people fighting againt these atrositys! And the people out there protesting & fighting back are not just black! 🤔🤔🤔🤔 now thats a thought!

All lives do matter yes right now most of the hate right now is between multicolor multicultural differences right now its sad to have this hate towards one another im sorry but I believe all lives matter don't matter what color what gender or religion or sexual orientation now we can not ignore this hateful racism acts and violence we are humans we all have blood flowing through our veins.,1

MrCosmin94 it’s sad you’re so ignorant. I’m legit agnostic and anyone that can make such an assumption against all possible evidence in a universe that has no reason to exist. That merely exists as a probably of 1/1trillion to the 13th power(which shatters the laws of probability according to Stephen hawking) and to deny any sort of evidence from the philosophical world,0

@Xeno People of Bristol were petitioning for years to remove the statue. It belongs to the people of the city after all.

Following your logic anytime anyone dies the all lives matter movement should go crazy. People are mad when people black get racially profiled and killed by the police because the police are supposed to protect everyone,0

Sunshine littlephilly I can’t even imagine how your thought process works... Do you not have the capability to shape your own opinion. Especially on a topic that DOES in fact hurt homosexual people. Whether you believe they should be harmed or not has nothing to do with it. When you publicly state a person is wrong for just living their life,0

Jack Parsons who called Trump a racist? You’re literally making things up. I’m calling you a racist. I’m educated enough in the matter where I feel like I can lecture you. I’m simply telling you when someone says “All lives matter” and “White lives matter,0
That was criminal damage plain and simple....the statue should be put back up and the cost should be taken from the Bristol city council budget..... the man was a lot more than just a slave trader (BACK IN THE 1700 HUNDREDS I MIGHT ADD),0

TheRealJacob603 no it is nothing like your comparison,0
The BLM movement may have been created as peaceful however the last time everyone was incited about this police were murdered so someone tell me that at some point BLM isn't respondsible. It's time if we want changes we need to find some other way that doesn't take innocent lives and businesses,0
what do you mean agree with homosexuality????,0

Where is famously inactive and on social media well known terrible bad  nUK police ..of course safe in shades (in safety wait  till  all is over)n  or  they (like alvays) hunting only  white native patriotic (not nracisstic) protesters who try only to protect their UK  democratic nrights and historical hertage and statues.

I just want to point out that the Bible does not say that homosexuality is a sin. The passage that I’ve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. “Men shall not lay with man” was originally meant to read as “man shall not lay with boy”. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship. Incorrect translations and interpretation of God’s words are harming real people on a daily basis.,1
Good job media and celebrities for dividing people even more,0
It really sucks at least in america you have freedom of speech for now. I can't believe in 2020 we are still having skin colour prejudice and issues as a result it is pathetic if in millennia we can't get past something so simple as to understand that diversity is a benefit to our survival as a species we are doomed.,1

All live matter is not a neutral statement it is a ignorant one. Just because we say BLACK LIVES MATTER does not mean we are saying BLACK LIVES ONLY MATTER....and the fact that when black lives matter started the whites wanted to say oh well all lives matter true but how come you want  to be all oppressed when it comes to something that deals with black people...  everyone is equal no tf we not we haven't been equal since the day we met and that we have to sit here and let these privileged ass people just think that nothing is going on...its not just black people getting shot...claps thank you for stating the obvious ....yeah Mexican Asian black white they catch them too but not as bad as we do,0

@ohwellwhateverr nOur environment/upbringing definitely has an impact on the way we see the world. But what I will not accept is some whiny little girls who feel like women need to be forced into careers that they have no interest in. Everyone decides where they go in life. And generally speaking there are differences in the interests of men and women,0
Ok I can understand y u would want this dudes story to be out and stuff but dont call him a survivor,0

For people who were judging Annie (and I read that she has come out now but I'm not sure if that's true) I was the same way when I was younger because I grew up in a religious family. But I was really really confused and hated myself because I couldn't understand why God would hate me if I like girls. Which for me made me try to prove even more that I didn't like girls at all. I finally left the religion two years ago and came out as bisexual. It's really scary if your family is homophobic and tell you that you are damned forever for that...,1

Well I mean if they're truly your friend then you aren't. Racism is rooted in a deep prejudice and hate towards someone of a different race. If you have a hate for someone can you be friends with them? I didn't think so. I have MANY black friends. This makes me.. not racist!! Because if I was truly racist I wouldn't associate with them and keep to my fellow whites. You guys need a dictionary sometimes.,1

Why doesn't Black Lives Matter protest the wars. 57 percent of the U.S. federal budget wasted on the military. That is what Martin Luther King protested and today the industrial military is far more extreme. Kids in the U.S. are forced to join the military out of desperation which is a form of economic slavery. This extreme hording of Tax dollars is why their is a lack of funding for social services,0
Take them down and put them in a museum. That’s the compromise tbh,0

Saying all lives matter is like the same thing as going to the doctor for a broken arm and expecting a full body cast you can make the argument that all lives matter which is true but we need to fix what is broken first. Nobody is saying other lives don’t matter of course they do but black lives are the ones at risk right now we’re just saying we matter too.,0

@ozzie pants nnThe reason I say I believe there could be closer to a 50-50 distribution in engineering is because there are many women who have strong enough math skills to go into the field who are currently choosing to go into other disciplines.n----I agree that women with high scores are likely to choose other majors. Female math geniuses are usually stronger in other subjects as well. Like I said before,1

I find it funny at the amount of attention the lack of female engineers gets while ignoring that females are outperforming males in every aspect of school BESIDES engineering. Females have such options to their career fields but men have not had the same options opening up for them outside of traditional job roles,1
Good luck!n2 more days to come!,0
everyone is hating on the girl who said she didn't agree with homosexuality. she has the right to her opinion and she doesn't have to agree with what others agree with. she never said that y'all are wrong or should burn in hell. she respected you. i don't understand why y'all hate on her,0

Juliette Almader i think she’s just young and hasn’t questioned her beliefs yet. I’m catholic too and I didn’t question my upbringing until my late teens.

I'm starting to agree with this statement more and more. Humanity is shitty and is a plague to this world.,0
MrCosmin94 and your statement “opening” people’s minds is completely invalid when you yourself have no prior knowledge to a actual topic. And making a point as bland as “who created god “ is like asking which universe created the universe. Because from a naturalistic view there has to be a natural non divine explanation. And based on the Laws of thermodynamics energy can’t just appear and disappear but be constant. So when you take nothing and create an infinite expanding universe with finite energy that is always constant and never created or taken away you come to question how that energy got there in the first place? It is the reasonable human reaction. So to tell people who have found peace in an answer for themselves makes you someone that can’t stand others happiness or comfortability. You would think being a human being you would have more compassion towards others and their own choices. Like I don’t judge you for yours,0

@Crystallization of the soul it's refreshing to see such guys. Most guys on these type of videos comment kitchen jokes . It's not easy for women in  STEM because they are constantly told to go back to the kitchen which is exactly why these videos are needed but even then manbabies tell you that your cognitive ability isn't any good even though they themselves can't do math.,1

I’m a black teenager but instead of focusing on police we need to focus on inner cities school education and stop making policies helping us bc it’s really hurting us but obviously black lives matter but I always question if BLM really cares about all black lives the ones who are lost to city violence that should be our focus but God Bless my black brothers and sisters,0

All lives matter implies that all lives matter. It doesn't mean to say that a certain group of peoples lives don't matter. It may also include groups that don't face any oppression and groups that do. It also implies that the oppressed groups should be equal to the non-oppressed group,1

Anonymous Anonymous ok bud why is it that ALM only comes up as a response to BLM. ALM doesn’t come into play until black people ask for the right to not be killed without consequences we know all lives should matter but atm black lives are the ones not mattering.

Because black people as a group are being targeted... hence why its important to mention black as it brings awareness. nnPlease educate yourself.,0
There has never been a question of all lives matter. The fundamental issue is black lives matter the same. This country has never questioned the value of white lives. It has historically undermined the lives of black and brown lives. The movement is questioning systematic racism and trying to bring the country to a balance state by addressing black lives and making our lives matter as well. There is not a black person that doesn't understand all lives matter,0
What about the rest of the world . all lives matter! we are all human!  Or do you you all just want attention,1

All these comments saying it's all left wings fault,0
I think that the girl who doesn’t agree with The LGBTQ+ community clearly doesn’t know enough about the subject to have a real opinion... my guess was that she was raised this way cause she didn’t really know who to describe why or how she disagreed. Just a thought,0

God does not want one to be lost . David was one he loved . And look at what he did . If he only loved Israel ? what about Nebuchadnezzar,0
sara leong I love science as well!!! But it is extremely hard for me to focus in math. Mainly because (probably because of classes arrangements) I am one of the only three girls in my math class of 12 and almost all the boys didn't know what staying on topic meant. They would yell and chat loudly. The teacher just seems to not hear them (probably because she has learned that it gave her less headaches). Anyways I love legos as well! I hope there's more people like you and your family in the world!!!,1

@hana bakkoush she was obviously raised differently than the other kids. I was raised extremely conservative and I considered myself hardcore conservative too and stayed that way until I met people that had different beliefs than my own. That wasn't until I was about 15.

@Flora Fauna Leftists have already removed history teaching from schools and replaced it with their agenda-driven pathology.  Im a 10th grader who see's it first hand,0
@MfZ you used the statement that animals dont practice homosexuality as your initial arguement,0
I had no part in making you feel bad. You already feel bad and want to blame other's for how you already felt about yourself. I have been kind to everyone in this thread. I would obviously have let you open up to me to tell me how you felt and would have been kind to you. You have no idea what things I have been though in my life,0

Hey- a lot of the people you may be thinking of did nothing against the law. You might not be aware about a kid foot instance called Elijah McClain who was going to the store and had the cops called as he was looking suspicious. Look up the story. Or other people who were just going home. I know people stopped constantly in their own car. On the way to work. In their Worker's Uniform. You know better now than to make a blanket statement like this.,0
There is a point where a good action becomes bad.,0
@Gregory Arrington To be honest,0
@royale with cheese Oh sure I can point it out ( just take a left near the black filled prison then take a right near the unemployed then go straight near the better treatment well and there you go you found the white privilege card also I know that everyone in life have been through some tough things but look at all the white men who get credit for what black people have done,0
Why would you show kids this,0

It’s a fact but it’s not the case at this time. We don’t have oppression at such a large scale by ‘all races’. There are problems in the black community that needs to be fixed at this very moment. Of course all lives matter but saying all lives matter against black lives matter is like math. You have a problem you need to solve so you solve one problem at the time,1

BBC Censored if you support BLM you’re just supporting democracies all lives matter,0
Kleo here I’ll give you an example. Alm is like you throwing a funeral for you child and then me coming in and beginning to talk and brag about my child and demanding my child get attention. Because all children matter my child should also be talked about. Actually,0

I'm glad kicking out those bleeding heart Obama Democrats solved the race issue. nGood thing Trump and the GOP solved this issue 5 years later. Neither party had an answer. Only the hearts and brains of the regular person can fix it and NO ONE seems to want to.  SMH.,0
All lives matter  because all people are created in the image of God.,1

Ugh God how I hate that one girl cause of everything she said... „I don't agree with homosexuality” what's going on with her mind,0
@Jimmy The Clown blessed be the fruit!,0
Candra Rakhmasari nYES!!! using religion to abuse someone and take away their rites goes against the golden rule. Do onto others as you want done to you. It goes against peace when treating people with hate. It makes me so mad when people use religion to abuse other people,1

All lives matter. Cops are abusive to all of us and there is a problem. Focusing on only black lives and shutting down the white person's voice is the Social Justice warrior way. It is totally destructive. The poor are being kept poor black or white. It is the poor that has more interaction with the police and are more susceptible abuse by the police. The minimum wage needs to be high enough so that anyone with a full time job should be able to buy a home,1
What moron gave this a thumbs down?!,0

I would have preffered to see this blown into smithereen Good Riddance.,0
These people only care about their own agendas,0
What i dont like about this interview is that she doesn't own being a heterosexual who supports the LGBTQ community. She is straight- children and all. But maybe she believes love is love. n.............. Either way lots of straight people liked her music as well. I wish all people the best. All lives matter.,1
@I am another person procrastinating in YouTube. Not one in the video of George Floyd's death did the police officer use a racist word,0

This must have been good fun after long lockdown,0
That's why she mentioned it was a cultural thing.,0

U can disagree yet still support someone that is homosexual. It’s her own opinion and choice.,1
All these things are happening under parental control (or the lack of it). Don't blame it on the system or any one political party or persuasion. This is a democracy and therefore it's possible to effect changes at the stroke of a pen,0

Who could not like this video. Over thousand people. I can only think it's because you think police brutality is O.K .That you hate unity .That you don't want change. or you just think black lives don't matter.Start with 400 year ago Than go to 100 years ago,0

The gap in her teeth is back,0
I'm sorry to say this but I don't think that she can do very much in order to inspire girls to become engineers with her product as it still heavily relies on the parents buying them. I believe that the real issue isn't getting girls interested in engineering but rather to prevent parents from pushing their kids into stereotypical roles because I think that the families that buy Miss Sterling's books are the same that would have also gotten their girls a variety of toys,1
I think it’s smart to get a homophobe in the mix. Hear what’s going on because of mindset of people like them.,0

@Delfinins Jezus they can,0
Because people are not surprised when a man says that. Engineering is not a unique enough job to the point of being a surprise itself. Think a little before asking dumb questions lol,0
well hes old so i guess his isnt much use anymore,0

All Lives Matter,1
I personally don't agree with alot of what is being said about black lives matter.it should be all lives matter.  A lot of people are starting riots and uprising against each other.  That makes these people look just as bad as some police who are wrong and. Do wrong if everyone prays and forgives we as a nation might still have a chance.,1
Black lives matter is the most racist statement I've ever heard in my LIFE !!!!!!!  can you imagine if we said White lives matter,1

Too much botox,0
Surely the protest should centre on changing legislation that allows police to commit these crimes in the first place,0
These idiots saying only black lives matter and others don't is such hypocrisy real Americans all matter and to say they don't is pure BS !!,0
@emmett Yeah and that's why you're a disgrace to LGBTIQ community,0
@Sisters 4 life do you even get what were saying. We are saying black lives matter right now but we didn't say all lives didn't matter but they do matter not just at the moment because the POC is getting targeted by the police and we want a change for your safety. But all lives do matter but not at the moment #BLACKLIVESMATTTER,0

look at them all trying to smash and jump on it ... not one big of damage done lol weak team,0
All these protests will soon end and the world will go on,0
The elephant in the room just needs to be mentioned. When we say Black Lives Matter a lot of people don’t understand what it really means so they call it racist.  I Know people that are white and Hispanic that held up the sign during the George Floyd protest. The reason why they did this was not  because they wanted to be black But  because they knew what it meant . In short it means that we matter  to but we feel like people that aren’t our color in general don’t recognize that we do. We know all lives matter everybody should know that. God loves us all but we don’t love us all.,0
“God gave us a choice. My choice is to love.” Kids are so fucking smart,0

@mya kahlo You would lie because it helps your case since I have said that you wouldn't understand from a POC perspective. So yeah...privileged white male. A classic non-supporter of the BLM movement. What's new.nnIf you look at their tactics and protests overall the intent it not to cause violence or harm.It's common sense that in any series of protests mob mentality can take over and violence will occur as a result. It doesn't make sense to pin it as the aim of the movement. In other words,0
Thank you for everything ! you and Alyssa Milano are my 2 biggest inspiration !!!,0
I'm also catholic.,0
All Lives Matter!!,1
I dont get how ppl think we have to agree with u breathing yet HeRe We ArE,0
Liz Cee BLM protests have made a difference. In Louisville there enacting reforms to no-knock warrants so tht cases like Breonna Taylor will hopefully no longer happen. Cities like LA and NYC have promised to cut funding of police departments and presumably invest in low income neighborhoods. So saying tht BLM isn’t helping in regards to police reform is ignorant.,0

I'm a Christian and I don't know how someone who can claim to love Jesus do these things to a person. This is unjust and cruel. We are told to love everyone equally and I can't stand for this! I'm so sorry people actually had to go through this. Have a wonderful day and stay strong you beautiful person. Don't let anyone tell you who you can and can't be.,1

I'm all in for equality but I think what the future holds for USA is akin to the aftermath of Nazi rule in Germany. The German government is now very apologetic to the Jews. People (Whites) maybe will become very sensitive to slight a black person? According to me,0

As she says women have a different perspective. In a field such as engineering where innovative ideas and thinking outside the norm is so rewarded there should be a definite demand for girls to have an equal chance for an engineering career.,1

@free man The desecration of our war dead deserves nothing less than lethal contempt.,0
I know  there is some sexism in the workforce and there is no doubt about that. But the thing that i hate is that these people are basically saying with all these stupid percentages that men need to change and help women into engineering and men are the problem that there aren't really any women in that field. And that is completely wrong the main reason that there aren't any women in engineering is because women just don't choose to go into that line of work. it's as simple as that.,1
all lives matter but black lives are not currently being treated equally. the goal of the BLM movement is to create equality not supremacy,1

Career choices depend on personality differences and result in differences in interest.  Women have different personalities than men and therefore they choose careers based around “people” 60% of the time.  Men choose careers based around “things” 60% of the time.

When y'all all talk at once,0

@Ashxr and we dont hate people for who they are like she said your looking at it wrong. We dont hate we just leave you alone. It simply means you do you but we arent apart of it.

DEFENDING the right of the LGBTQ community to live however they like and being accepted for who they are AND in the same time ATTACKING someone because they have a different opinion/belief (maybe similar to what those horrible people are justifying their actions with) as long as they are not personally hurting anyone is highly HYPOCRITICAL.nIf you don't have anything good to say respectfully,1

Why is it controversial to say 'all lives matter?'   Are you serious!!!!!!!! Did they really have to say Black lives ALSO matter?'  or Black lives matter AS WELL?' in order for you people to know what they were saying? Come on!

I took up an Industrial Engineering course long time ago I didnt finish my course. 1st year to 3rd year I was doubting myself that I cannot make it to the final year and when I reached the 4th year that was the moment that I was so eager to finish the course but unfortunately I wasn’t able to enrol for 2nd semester due to financial challenges. When the speaker said that they were on 5 female students in the class...I remembered those days when we were also 5 girls and no excuses on all of our classes and demos. I am now 36 years old. I don’t see myself going back to study and continue the same course but I really wish I did.,1

The true racists are Obama and the democrat politicians get this the white politicians and Obama are related look it up and then ask again why is mixed race obama who is both races hating on whites  because white democrats politicians told the idiot to start a race war Obama’s not the brightest bulb in his democratic family that’s why he’s ordered to start a race war he’s owned you can see it.,0

I’m stunned by the number of sexist comments by males here. What’s more interesting to me is why so many males are insecure about the fact that women are entering the field of engineering. This isn’t a war - what are you so afraid of? That your masculinity/intelligence is under attack? Well,1

Y’all really need to let go. Yes we know all lives matter. That’s a given. But the reason why people have to say black lives matter “too” is because black lives have it mattered since the 1800s!!! We know like white lives matter that has been proven that white lives matter over all of her lives in America time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again. Nobody has ever questioned if all lives matter. So that part of the conversation is over with and irrelevant. Now let’s concentrate on the lives that have not mattered in America. Please concentrate and focus on what needs to be done to help. Don’t concentrate on what needs to be done to perpetuate the current paradigm. It is time for a change. All lies has always mattered and white lives has mattered above all in black lives has mattered the least in America. Stay focused people..,1

Seeing a politician answer that question when they know that white deaths are double that of black deaths per year yet they are afraid to say so. All lives do matter we are all humans like it or not and yes BLM to.,0
@Sister Sidney the reason the civil rights movement was so powerful was because people were protesting like civilized people not running around lighting stuff on fire acting like fools. That why this is a joke. Black lives do matter for sure I'm all for that statement but people are saying black lives matter but are using the statement to do ignorant things. Maybe it would be taken more serious if people acted like adults and not children.,0
To the ones who think or feel... not all religious people are bad. In this case we are assuming christianity for right know.

But I realized not all of them will hate me,1

I was inspired as a women to believe in myself and be a strong independent women. I was raised with no encouragement and to be powerless. She rocks 🤙 OMG nearly cried to her comment at the end ‘never give up’,1
A lot of you are writing how that girl is going to suddenly realise like you did that she isnt straight etc etc because of the way shes dressed and stuff but regardless if thats true or not its rarely easy to come to terms with your sexuality especially if youve been raised to be against it. People saying this about her is most likely going to make her feel uncomfortable and upset. And while yes that isnt something someone should be feeling towards the LGBT community its likely the mental state shes is so like leave it lads,1
it isn't. all lives matter,1
The truth is All lives matter,1
This is awesome. Very inspiring,1

Think about it this way by only saying black lives matter you are putting down every other race including Native Americans. They have it every bad because they got pushed out of their homes where their beliefs are so their basically taking a page out of Hitler’s book and say that Black is the master race when that isn’t true because there is no master race everyone should be equal.,1

Can people please stop saying Annie should “come out of the closet” or she is in for a “rude awakening”. Like really guys?! Dont judge her off of her appearance! You are going off of stereotypes,1

@Molly Rebekah Saying you dont agree with homosexuality is like saying you dont agree with being black. It's not a choice and it doesnt hurt anyone.

Watching this before I study cause I'm feeling to lazy to do so.,1
Here's my question. Why do black or most black people hate All Lives Matter? Could it be that black folks in america don't give a crap about any other race but their own? Wasn't the black people from Africa the real slave owners and slave traders of their own kind? Do they ever protest if the cop was black instead of white or some other race?,0
Lorenna Kocijancic well spoken . In 1964 I went to live with my grandparents and my grandfather was the Chief of police in our town and held that position for 22 years for a total of 33 years as a cop. Back then in the 60s he told me being a cop was thankless and Glorious job. I see a lot of my grandfather in that sheriff knowing their beliefs are the same.,0
They’ve got my support; and thousands of others. Plus the council were taking it down anyway - they were waiting to do so as part of redevelopment because it saved them money that way. They shouldn’t have taken so long.,0
TJ probably doesn't like man butts. He's said in the past,0

When she said,0
All Lives Matter' is derogatory as it is contradicting  'Black Lives Matter',0
He would be so disappointed. Remember I have a dream to live in a world where my four children will be judged by there character not by there skin color. Then black lives matter happens and all lives matter is racist apparently and freedom of speech is dead. You disagree your racist or sexist. What happened to the world. There's only one race the human race. History is not perfect from any perspective. Everyone has been a slave look at the gladiators for example there's plenty more as well don't forget about prisoners of war. You can't sing certain music due to certain words if there so offensive or only one race can say them then take that word out.,1

Very reasonable and well thought out. I agree and further more can add that a number such as the ratio of men to women in engineering fields does not show there is a problem. Rather this demonstrates that despite a  level playing field women as a whole don't want to be or may dream about it but are not willing to put in the work as frequently as men are. I was listening to a consultant for law firms talk about female lawyers and the legal field has a hard time hanging on to female partners after 30 years old. This iss not based on their skills because they will have earned their place,0
A kind gentle man has to endure torture because he just prefers his own gender. Whatever sexual acts he does at least 90% of heterosexual women do for their partners also. Why is it so terrible. What is wrong with religious people to condemn something that is neither bad or unnatural. The profess to be the religion of love yet are so hateful and intolerant.,1

I love that you guys are coming at this from a full heart and really trying to help children understand the new world that they live in today some people may be against us some people may be for it but whether you’re against learning about the way the world actually works or not doesn’t mean that the world doesn’t still actually work and if your children are going to be productive people in our society then they should learn about our new society,1

Not to mention their environment as a whole. If they really wanted to make a point then they should've just found a way to bring the statue down to the city council and leave it outside.,0

What seems SATANIC here is you...,0
THE MAJORITY OF RACISTS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE BLACK!  EMPOWER BY RACIAL LEFT DEMOCRATS.,0
can't we all just get along?!,0
All lives matter...everything else is blatant evil racism.,1
Do all those black people not realize that if we never colonized them they would still run after their food with a stick?,0
Wired has been like this for quite a while!,0
@Po Po it sure sounds like that's what they are saying. And I'm mixed race.,0
sheriff David Clarke is the man.,0
Never was a great fan but this does change my opinion of her.,1
Not all lives matter. Evil Marxist scum on the left doesn't matter at all to me. I care more for an ant then all the evil Marxist democrats.,0

The same community that discriminates if you dont have the right looks,0

Why tf r dey teaching this to kids disgusting wtf dey don’t even kno there times tables 🤢🤢🤢,0
Todd Baer what about it?,0
I honestly think it should be changed to Black Lives Matter Too.  That acknowledges that All Lives Matter without diminishing the emphasis on  black lives.  It quiets,0
The dictator has been topplednnBut your black lives matter is a racist ideology of its own,0
Blue lives mightier protect the cops,0
I would really like to know TJ's stance on the whole a 15 year old black girl is the new iron man thing... hopefully he can make a video on that soon.,0

@Baden Jones here's the link to the video,0
@Xean Frost you just compared hundreds upon hundreds of years of oppression with a minor inconvenience. please open up your mind and see how life is for people. just because you lack melanin doesn't inherently mean you lack compassion,0
Another group of people from history also removed things they didn't like. My grandfather fought against them only to have the very ideology come to the UK. Today I am ashamed to come from Bristol. lest we forget,0
MrReubenTishkoff  lol yeah,0
@wow i am lost yes the is a devil in every human that encourages racism that devil we call arrogance. Also every ethnicity is proud of his origin. I would not want to be any colour but black.,0
2020 is tragic man,0
Go to old age home bernie,0
Watched this again 4 years later in 2020.  Same old crap.  Sorry we missed Sheriff Clarke in Kenosha.  Protestors against police in Milwaukee bringing young childre to the event..how will that shape children's perception of police officers as they grow up?  And a photographer stated that police show up aggressively.....well...wouldn't you be stressed out and on guard when people are calling for your harm?  I don't know if we can come back from this.,0
@Literal Scumbag lifestyle - the way in which a person or group lives,0

Feminist do not want equalitynwomen already have equality in the westnwomen have more rights then menna women has all birth control rights while men have nonnwomen are always favored when a male is trying to get his children back when the wife is the abuser nwomen are always favored in society while no one gives a shit about men,0
Seinfan - there ARE lots of calls for men to take those roles!!!,0
Where's Sheriff Clarke been lately? I will do some research to see what he has said in recent months. I love David Clarke,0
they are being oppressed though,0
@Emily Campbell he also starved to death  4 million in bengal,0
thanks for encouraging me to fight with dignity once again... appreciation to the tips and real life facts... Respect!,1
@Borninthe WrongCentury Ok weirdo...,0
What about Native American Lives!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
@Creamage Aw. Mine are dead too,0
ALL LIVES MATTER. To say anything else is ridiculous. To be equal is to be considered as a whole. There are unfair things that happen and people need to be held accountable. But to divide ourselves is not helping anything,1
@Po Po your not making sense about the all three given bandages with one only having a cut.? Who's got the cut...the white ? No. You would say otherwise. Why would you?,0
how are they not being taken seriously? Most of the ones with 10+ years of experience are in pretty high positions. About the comment of 'this is a room full of engineers,0
Crystal s a fantastic child!!,0
All lives matter!!! ridiculous to think otherwise!!!,1
So just stop that,0
And why because he was black geht mit so much Moby or No Job,0

I would tell her to shut up and sing but I don't think she can sing anymore cans she? Wasn't the best to begin with. Lady Gaga is much better. I think gays need to stick with Gaga.,0
@Hello! I am tired She has to be trolling,0
Amazing how those numbers are SO much better for all Americans and the dimocrats still hate our President Trump,0
I just realized that what is happening now is the same thing that was happening back then,0
As a bisexual woman... I smell a bisexual woman in this video,0

Black lives matter. Black and white people are rightfully protesting. But ALL lives matter. Including white ones,0
I really wish someone would tell me what Obama did for the black community that is good. No one ever can answer,0

@Grip enforced?? They are letting the criminals out of jail so they can commit more crimes,0
White lives matter is considered racist as hell so why isn't Black Lives matter racist also.,0
I love sheriff Clark he truly has the perfect job for his WIT. I hope he ends up running for office in the future.....he would have my vote,0
Your not black if you don’t vote Biden lol black votes matter !!!!!,0

so uh why they dumping the statue in the water isnt that littering i thought leftists cared so much about the environment lol,0
Sunshine littlephilly God told you personally he didn’t agree with it?,0
Yes plastic surgery,0
Conversion therapy doesn't do anything,0
Because not all lives are being targeted and by saying that it's like saying you are oppressed just the same as the unarmed getting shot.,0
Jessica Walker nThat can also be interpreted in many waysnAnd it’s translated from a dead languagenFrom a priest who couldn’t even speak the languagenA language that is impossible to translate properlynYou sure God really said that?,0
Wtf is up with the negativity by men here? Just because she's building toys for girls and encouraging them to go for engineering majors,1

Buffalo Soldier....Stand up for your rights !!,0
All Lives Matter,1
For the people who are religious....the onlllyyy thing God wants is to respect one another and love each other....then how does this make sense its not really christianity it's the church in old times which had power over people christianity was the excuse to get people to do what they want,1
She is my new role model,1
@Destinee I have the same aspirations as you do! I want to make my family proud and show them that women can be scientists and engineers,1
If you say all lives matter well that doesn’t help the democRATS to manipulate black. It doesn’t go along with their race war agenda. nIt’s a destructive agenda.nUNITY IS HUMANITY nStand together nIn the end,0
As far as the Left is concerned....NO LIFE MATTERS!,0
Yeah I said it in a game and this girl saying blm got so mad,0
@Ajay Dahl right!,0

You can't change the world with hate you just make hate  and you can't change people without showing a changing in yourself if someone going stay corrupted  the rest of the world ain't going to change for you and some people and going to change you just got to be happy in your life amongst a world full of haters,1
@PepeThePoopyPants I believe women should have the freedom to work and vote and live as anyone else,1
Through violence you may murder the hater,0

He was speaking facts god bless police and Americans,0
It doesn’t fit the narrative.  Need to make the people dependent on the state.. not individuals but a collective hive.  All lives do matter.  Need to set the black people free from the welfare state.,0

All live matter - saying Black Lives Matter ignores the flight of American Indians & Hispanics who also suffer.,0

skin is not a race it is an organ that covers our body. if it is black white or whatever colour it is only an organ. what is wrong with people. if black lives matter so much why are they killing their unborn children at such large numbers.  BLM only cares about getting money for their movement and not the people who they claim to be fighting for. they don't care about anyone but their bank accounts or the cities where black people live would be improving but they are not. explain that one. and with these last riots how many black businesses were destroyed by these  black lives matter groups,1

Once again Juan trivializes,0
@Savy the Niller Waffer oh,0
I actually agree with her when she said it’s a cultural problem. There are countries where girls have a hard time being in STEM  and countries where they are mostly completely fine. I personally grew up going to a math and physics based lyceum that was super hard to get into and we had about 5 or 6 boys  in a class of 30 people. We had a blast and our gender  was never an issue. I don’t know if it would be the same if we weren’t a majority but all the girls went on to become engineers,1
I’m 12 and I’ve known I was into girls since I was 6. When I was 9 or 10 I didn’t know about homophobia and things so I came out to some of my friends ( I also didn’t know they were religious) and they told a lot of people at my school,1

He's just a puppet for the democrats. How can you say,0
Technically you can. In your experience,0
Several deaths can be directly and indirectly linked to conversion therapy. From suicide and long term impacts from the physical abuse such as brain or limb damage to some links to hate crimes against the failed projects of some of these camps.,1
Black lives don’t matter all lives matter,0
Let's make some mental gymnastics (it will require a LOT of it) in order to assume homosexuality can be cured. Done ? Ok. How are you going to cure someone by hitting them and make them repeat the same thing over and over again on a daily basis ? This is no therapy. There's nothing therapeutic in being hurt or brainwashed. How do we still call those... things therapies ? This is nothing more than legal abuse. Parents who send their child there would say i'm sending my child in a place where they will be abused both mentally and physically if they were honest about themselves. Then add the usual I love them and see if it makes sense.,1

Its not controversial,0
I think all lives matter instead of saying black lives matter we should all come together and be saying all lives matter Skin colors shouldn't change our feelings for each other but my opinion on George Floyd is that he didn't deserve to die but I do not think he's a hero because he was a criminal and I can't forgive him for when he held a gun up to a pregnant lady's baby hump and said he would shoot her baby hump and the lady herself,1

@Daniel Whyatt the majority of the people in Bristol and surrounding area like having statues of slave traders?,0
@NOXISUM you really couldn't have been more racist with that comment. I'm African American and I support the all lives matter statement. You sit there and say white people make it about them. Uhhh no it's not just white people its every other non black race and they're not trying to bash this protest. But why can't it just be about police brutality and racism in general. Black people and white people get hated on all the time and that goes the same for Asians and Hispanics. The all lives matter thing is saying police brutality needs to end and so does racism. And do you really think black people aren't racist against white people. I just saw a video of a group of black people beating the sh!t out of white people and setting their cars on fire. Like what kinda response is that. It seems like you think only black people know struggle racially or otherwise and that's just not true.,1
The left already hates him.,0

Exactly!..... I guess that’s not what they’re fighting for.... Obviously ...So many innocent people have died ... Business is ruined.... people hurt and injured.....for what ? For who’s behalf ? How can one justify this ? ..... I thought the whole point was for the country to come together for the good of the country and for everyone...,1
All lives mattter of course. The issue is tbat Black Lives haven't mattered as much,0
im glad they got a male perspective to balance the discussion... dafuq. you know how much easier it is to get a job as a woman. they want to hire 50% women when theyre 20% of grads. how is that equal for a generation thats been taught woman can do anything as good as men. it should be about ability not genitals. i totally agree on that point.,1
Keep believing the propaganda bullshit everyone,0
Removing a statue commemorating a slave trader is not destroying history,0
@Killua ZoldyknnWhat's the use in rioting in the streets of Baltimore for it though?,0
@Drew Saluk It doesn't say that. The Bible already gives extramarital affairs the thumbs-down elsewhere. There's no need to mention the homosexual angle if that were the case. The passage in question makes it pretty clear that the lying with another man part is what's particularly offensive. Furthermore,0
The fact that they boo at white lives matter,0
James With the m3 did you just say black lives don’t matter you are a racist,0
@Chris L agreed.,0
Wall Street Hamster Can you provide an example?,0

Hiho Kids you guys are doing amazing work. Once again I'm so happy and grateful that you guys are expressing what goes around  and coming into this world.  Kids need to know what goes around and understand what LGBTQ COMMUNITY and people who comes out and share what they went through their lives.  Such a awesome  Message that you all are showing.,1
honestly why can't we all just get together whether we be black or white,1
Madonna if only you realised how much you affected my life through your music and passion ... you have brought me so many happy moments and for countless others,1
After watching this im convinced I have potential. I loved playing with my dads construction tools and building games.  lol a bit too simple.

I have no idea where I'm gonna land lol.,1

@***** CITATION PLEASE. People who say that institutional racism exists in the modern first world are like the feminists crying about their boogey man called the Patriarchy'.,0
I don’t think testing school kids on science is really indicative of STEM aptitude. Girls brains develop faster and they are typically better students early on. Also,1
Sadly it is being put as a trend. But black people are still suffering and they are downplaying us and trying to shut us up.nWe just want racial equality and to defund the police. It seems they are doing everything but that. But we shouldn’t use this important movement to turn attention to something else that isn’t the matter at hand. We will fight for equality then we will spread out to those regions too. They are all equally as important but we have to stay focused. I hope you understand this.,1

@ thanks..i can see where you are coming from too..makes sense you dont want to categorise people with their race..but i have to refer to the certain group of people somehow when talking about this issue..when i say black people or whatever it is meant in the least racist way..thanks for understanding me though,0

I would fire each one of these woman anybody who whines and complains like this needs to be fired you will make excuses every time crap doesn't go your way everyone has to prove themselves in engineering and a lot of feels like that because you do not get a free pass just because you've had success you have to prove yourself each time that goes for men older people younger people woman groups and individuals anyone can fall out of favor and anyone can succeed over others if people look at you a certain way when you walk in a room probably because you are a big whiny complainer and they know they're going to have to deal with your BS constantly whining about this and that that has nothing to do with the work if affirmative action was gone tomorrow these people would be the first on the chopping block they make office spaces work environments and team groups in hospitable towards each other because everyone has to step around eggshells with them end of demoralizing the and the whole office atmosphere,0

@Molly Rebekah  You are just as bad as everyone else yeah not everyone believes in God I don't either and you may think you are doing good but you are actually causing harm do you think LGBT people choose to be LGBT no bc if it was a choice no one person would choose to be discriminated against and beaten up and killed for who they love conversion therapy is awful and shouldn't even be a thing and I get it you are religious but the Bible never really mentioned homosexuality you just took that one part and said oh this must mean homosexuality when it could mean many things and let's not forget to Bible has been translated so many times from the original version we don't really know what it says and I don't wanna hear anything about the your religion,1

Natsuki Masamune Where are you going with this?nNot interested in having a conversation with you,0
What i don't understand about most of these comments is that people are saying that girls with short hair are automatically lesbians or the clothes they're wearing. Looks don't Define Who You Are. It doesn't mean if a girl has short hair or if they're clothes not girly enough doesn't mean girls are automatically lesbians!! You can't just put a label on someone and call them something that they are not without knowing their real lives and stories!!,1

How many lives should they directly cause to end before this stops? What type pathetic pandering is this garbage? None of what is happening is about Floyd. You're a joke of a channel with a weak minded and lying writer. nnThe racism of low expectations... how does it feel to openly engage in this??nnWhat an absolute joke.  You don't care about lives lost.  Liars. You don't care about racism. Nonsense. You're not in a battle for civil rights. You're liars who treat an entire race like they are children.,0
They don't want that,0
The sad thing is this is the least abusive conversion therapy I've ever heard of. My friends have scars and burns where they were shocked and burned and tortured. It was so bad that you have to pretend to change to get away from it. There is no shame in lying to end the torture. I wasnt put in that situation but I was homeless for a bit,1
It wasn’t erected as a symbol of slavery... it wasn’t a symbol of racial profiling... it was erected as historical significance for what he did to help build in the city... on the basis of your argument you’d have idiots destroying 90% of all historical buildings and monuments in the uk. Protest peacefully not ok to go around defacing property as a mass mob. Abide by the law or face the consequences....stupid sheeple committing crimes... an eye for an eye is not acceptable... democracy and justice is...,1

Why is it clowns like this guy dress up like cowboys ? If sailors dressed like pirates they would get laughed off the dock. Grow up people and use your minds instead of following cartoon characters.,0
I've never been a fan of Madonna's 'music' nor do I like her personality but I do love that she has been a great friend to the LGBTQ community. Also,1
@Emilia they mean that the fact that girls don't normally choose STEM fields is because we are socialized to be interested in other stuff. Which is a bad thing because when someone does break the norm,1
Also “my choice is to love” is a more powerful statement than I think that child realized. That is incredibly beautiful and heartwarming to hear.,1

....poor American First Nations are just left out in the cold........,0
The use of black live matter does not mean other lives don't matter. That's not at all the point of the phrase. It's like when the save the sea turtles movement was popular a while back. Just because people want to save the sea turtles doesn't mean that all other fish are irrelevant and don't matter. They simply believe that turtles being endangered is something that needs attention,0
Well in my opinion some lives don't matter,0
This is ridiculous.  No one can have an open and free debate and discussion.   To say all lives matter is perfectly reasonable yet is met with derision.   All white politicians are in fear and terror.,0

Madonna in her songs and her voice have always been there as a way to comfort me,1
Because the people out there protesting are full of hate and have been ruled by the Democrats for years. And  they have no concept of what's really going on or has gone on in the world because they only watch CNBC,0
Crystal is so articulate. i love listening to her just talking. she sounds very smart,0
I was thinking about vistiing the US to see my mom in Florida. I am seriously reconsidering that when everybody booed at the term all lives matter or even worse white lives matter That means if i get killed by  an Afro American that is not a racial thingy but instead an outcry of the so called oppressed Afro Americans?  Do not get me wrong i trully believe in ALL LIVES MATTER Wow that sheriff is one badass;-),0
Liberal democrats suck!nGrow some already.,0
Of course it will not work. Cannot change who a person are. Then they will only play with not to be judged But get depressed and not have a life. Some talk about the bible,1
How many red heads got shot in one year?,0
That was a chaotic mess...,0
@SEEMS LEGIT is what it should have been called,0

I am a girl in 6th Grade who is interested in STEM. Whenever I tell people that,1
I hate 2020,0
everyone booing when anyone says that all lives matter,0
Juan is a political panderer.,0
Juan you are a MORON.  Next you'll say there is no black on black violence,0
God clearly doesn't exist,0
Covid will come back scarier and more infectious next time because of the idiots not wearing the masks and special protection at protests although masks aren’t always going to keep covid away half of the time so most people will get covid in the second wave,0
She looks like she's taken a lot of valium.,0
I’m lesbian and Christian and I think that’s completely okay...God doesn’t hate anybody ‍,1
U dont have to agree.. freedom of speech,0
Media egging people on by reminding them of the statues in other cities. Why else would they even mention it?,0
It feels strange to call the actions of the first story blackmail. But it's really what it was,0
@Chinskins Tron  I have already given you the scripture in the other comment,0
“That would just be...ah...pure mean.” I can’t 🤣🤣,0
That would be uh just pure mean. I love that kid awesome answer,0
Why so suddenly do the White politicians believe black lives matter? To make you believe they feel that. If they did it would of been said long ago and you all suckers believe they mean it .,0
I'm 23 and currently thinking of changing my career path from business into software engineering,1
Sasha Dumse he also told humans to love each other,1
Testicle Thief so will your name,0
I think it’s not that you CANT become one,0
NO LIVES MATTER UNTIL BLACK LIVES MATTER TOO,0
Mike S changed the world ? Lol seriously calm down,0
this was awesome.,0
Was wrong about my first reply. The greatest commandment is to love the lord your God with all your heart mind body and soul.,0
I tear up when I even hear the words conversion therapy,0
Kinda weird what happens with society when there is disconnect from religious principles.,0
@Dirieh Ngongo Black lives mattered since the civil rights act was passed in 1964. Everyone knows black lives matter in the modern day and age. But you cannot shy away from the fact that there are and always will be individual racists by constructing a movement that is completely counterproductive to the African American community. Blaming it on factors such as systematic racism that clearly doesn't exist for black people. Let's take college acceptance for example. A black candidate for being a student in the school premise is more sawn after than a person of yellow colour with the same qualifications. Now tell me how you guys have it worse that isn't of your own doing. By creating this victim mentality you literally take all hope away from them with the lies you radicals have created.,0
She is rare species. Both engineer and so beautiful.,1
@Margarita Sytcheva n  And Austria is not the US.,0
@Jessica Walker saying you don't agree with the LGBT community is like saying you don't agree with black people. we don't have a choice to choose our sexuality or skin colour.,1
I can’t believe she’s 61 and looks like she’s 25 is she even human???,0
Amen. I can’t wait.,0
Floyd was a criminal,0
Ramon Murray I am not all women,0
“All lives matter”n“Boo! How could you be so inclusive of everyone! Boo you!”n“...what?”,0
Its not controversial. Its snowflakes crying because it takes the attention away from them,0
@Movie Jimmy 777 are you an idiot? Just asking. Because what I wrote in my last comment,0
Enlighten us with the real truth you know.,0
We were all made in God’s image. All lives matter!!!,1
@Sasha Dumse and god made other humans to love each other,1
We are all equal in the eyes of our Lord God and Lord Jesus. ALL LIVES MATTER!,1
@Splash 29 he got what was coming to him white lives matter,0
We can no longer use BLM as a political bargaining chip. Black lives mattering is great concept as all lives matter. Just as I am not immune to criticism,0
@Sérgio Alves  I understand where you're coming from,0
Fear NOT blacks folks . .  . our time has come at last!!,0
All this time I wasn't aware that John Wayne the movie star was a racist and had racist comments! All this time I watched his movies on and off thinking he was the ideal American for the good guy! Nothing can be further from the truth! I don't cater to racism or racism Commients! I disown and spit out of my mouth every John Wayne movie I have ever seen!,0
@James Garcia HY Pocnsy a noun the parctice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which ones own behavior does not conform pretense OG arrington back to the study with respect,0
Jihad? Holy war? The only thing these leftists are at war against is common sense,0
Marcus is such an incredible individual and the kids are so wonderful and open minded in their questions and hearts. GODDAMN. I’m crying.,0
David Clarke is the kind of man that causes men to question their manhood.,0
ALL lives matter!  That includes all baby’s. Jesus help this world!,1
The wage gap would be better represented as people that's worked for it vs people that havent instead of white vs black,0
@***** Stop lying to yourself honey.,0
I'm surprised Juan agreed to come in on this one lol,0
Someone coined a term to bring light to an issue. However others want to change the term that ends up deflecting the purpose of the term.  Cause we are trying to make you focus on lives that others don't think matter which is black lives.,0
I have an important question to the Lgbtq community,0
Respect to the Sheriff. Nothing but sense.,0
@César Valdivia it's just the beginnings of it.,0
dude there are black lives matter groups in england for some reason.,0
Madonna thought me to be on the side that's winning . & if any side should loose . Then jump cause it's bad 4 concert ticket sales .,0
alexcnb nI’m good at tracheostomy’s. Keep still.....,0
@Alexhs Savvakhs stop using color language. BLM is anti-white propaganda. It is racist. It only increase hatred of black men to white people. It makes segregation among human based on color. If you want to stop racism,0
LovelyLPSCrew OP said “internalized” - i don’t think you’re understanding the point lol,0
Indiana Rose Yup   Designer clothes tons of make up,0
@HermesLVDiva1976 you're dumbed down 100%,0
Totally agree! All Lives matter!,1
If we only care about 1 life of race,0
Bla bla bla.....Am I the only one tired about hearing about Floyd.  He was convicted of robbing a pregnant woman.  Look it up.,0
Dean Bray how do you resist on the floor with a white man on top of you  and let’s remember who had the gun,0
i’m 12 years old and i’m bisexual,1
That sheriff would be such a badass actor in action movies,0
If you think that black lives matter means only black lives matter you've shown your own ignorance this movement of black lives matter is a cry out saying black lives matter also... It is sick that a cop would shoot an unarmed or non lethally armed black man. Whites get killed by the cops but 9 times out of ten they were in the wrong the problem is the gross misconduct of excessive jail time and innocent black lives in jail. That's what these people started the black lives matter movement and it's media who have the responsibility to convey the grievances of the people yet you leave us wanting... There are bad protesters and there are bad cops but untill police brotherhood is disbarred and cops work like Walmart employees where they see someone in the wrong they stop it instead of covering it up we're gonna sit here and stew in the wreckage of our ignorance.,0
The democrats don't give a crap about black lives the only thing that concerns them is gaining power and holding on to it. Saying ALL lives matter is only controversial to the democrats BLM and ANTIFA because it detracts from their narrative.,0
I think it’s time to military steps and just mowers everybody down to 40 Bravoz,0
People are such tools.  Everything the media and the left are doing are at the behest of scheming cowards hiding out of sight,0
@Majestic Camels Funny how whenever it happens nobody is allowed to mention on the news that its blacks doing the stabbings even though everyone they interview about it is black!,0
​@baily my dog Did any cop ever arrest you for no reason other than you looked suspicious due to the colour of your skin? Honest Question,0
Innocent lives are being killed daily in abortion. Yes,0
i am pursuing electrical engineering and i donno why this brought me in tears.,1
How do you racially profile in a black community?,0
This inspired me so much. As a CS major,1
Whatever happened to Coronavirus? Remember how governments and the elites told us to stay at home and not gather in large groups because of this Deadly Virus. Now the same Elites are supporting this large groups of people gathering and some don’t even speak out against This. nHypocrisy.,1
Yes that was genuine. Bless her. Never give up hope love you lady.x,1
I really hope I can become an engineer and and influencer like you some day !  God bless,1
I know many critics have buried her in the past few years,0
You inspired me to keep moving on my engineering program. You are amazing thanks alot!,1
It breaks my heart. nIt breaks my heart that this still exists.,0
I'm currently a sophomore doing ME and Mathematics. This video really helped! Wish me luck on my finals next week.,1
A change for what? Bombing yugoslavia and signing doma lol,0
I wouldn't say I'm AGAINST homophobia and people who are homosexual (also part of the LGBTQ+ community) as AGAINST is too much of a strong word. I don't agree with it,1
Exactly! I’ve thought of becoming a pilot and currently studying computer science which are both male dominated industries sometimes i cant help but also worry about how my future in these fields of career would be like would i be lonely? will i be not as as good? These talks really just gives me some sort of a motivation to move forward,1
Most female engineers I work with are not native USA. Austrian,1
Gays are just broken people,0
Who the F disliked this? I mean ... if you're racist,0
This was bad enough a few years ago. Now it's beyond reprehensible. BLM is a cult group that is racist against WHITES!!! It's evil.,0
That would just be uh,0
Who will be purged?,0
Who in politics isn't whoring for votes?!?! Cmon the bias on Faux news is crazy. Dems are whores and GOP are whores.nnNothing is wrong with saying,0
I just dont understand why saying All Lives Matter is offensive. It literally includes everybody,0
Come on people I do not want to defend trump,0
As a Christian,0
I have always loved her and her soul. Madonna you are amazingly inspirational.,0
Hi Tina.. Indeed you are right. nnYou'll of course notice that this video was posted nearly five years ago (October 15th 2015),0
All lives are what you make of them. nWe are all born and we will all die,1
There are too many edgy people in this comment section,0
Debbie Sterling's lecture  is so far the best lecture I have seen. I actually can relate to this cause my case is also quite similar to hers,1
THIS WAS VERY INSPIRATIONAL TO ME,1
@Pratibha Shetty yes great one I no what it takes to be an engineer......I am also a female mechanical engineering,1
Im going to be an industrial engineer,0
my lives is matter,0
We don't want a race war,1
@ExpressoSupresso duhhh because ONLY black lives matter,0
Those responsible should be found and charged.  Just because Bristol is now full of blacks doesn't mean they can change it's history.  The statue should be re-erected as a sign that vandalism will not be accepted.,0
Black lives matter was invited to lead the parade by Pride Toronto,0
I think this incident will shoot- up racism in western countries ...🤦‍🤦‍🤦‍,0
Thank you for sharing your story Marcus x,1
As yet another white male in the tIT technical area I support and salute all of you!  Keep kicking ass.  I've encountered many very technical women and they're just people.  Just technical minded people.  I've never treated them any differently than a male.  Shitty this isn't the case for the majority.  Again keep kicking ass!  🤘,0
They can't even get along with each other.,0
No no no no no no! As an artist and as a guy I'm going to tell you a secret! Just because your brain is wired differently and you are more emotional than your male counterpart does not meant you can develope certain habilities,0
If all lives matter then all lives should be treated the same. But it's not when you are arresting white people but killing black people so yes BLM,1
You can see some of my artwork and fashion designs here...if you're interested. n,0
Slavery at that time was legal and more profitable for Africa. Stop thinking that slavery was kidnapping people. These statues remind us the past,0
I am currently a female engineering student (Bachelors Degree)....You have really moved me Debbie with your story...WoW! Thank you,1
I sense that the silent majority have very nationalistic principles being developed because of this madness be careful with what you think in response to these disgusting idiots who are anti society,0
She turned 61 just months after this interview.,0
The boy or girl in the red needs to stop hating on homosexuals cause he or she clearly has some issues with him or herself,0
She's my favourite!,0
As a religious person I don't support LGBTQ+ but I respect them as who they are.,0
She's 61 ys old right.,0
kuggacourage gx the name isn’t “Only Black Lives Matter” and it’s actually very obvious what it’s about but ig not to everyone,0
That boy who wanted advice on how to be there for his friend was so sweet. I hope he never changes and stays just as sweet and kind when he grows up,1
Richard Littler she saved it mine also in so many ways...... no words,0
What about the Blond Ambition Tour dancers????????,0
Crystal likes Doctor Who,0
@Jacob Duffy thanks. Looks like my comment has been deleted though unfortunately. Wonder why? I didn't say anything offensive.,0
@Amazing Worenwu K well how about I say all lives are equal? Better?,0
Whats wrong with her down lip?,0
You have got to keep up the lgbtq hahahaha,0
people who say that coming out is useless should watch this video.,1
Miles Han You guys are way too focused on words. Its not just the term “Black Lives Matter” that pisses people off,0
Racist is like jealousy it's here to stay cheers,0
My choice is to love perfect answer because God is Love so that's why the gospel needs to be spread through  testimonies and exposing the false churches that the devil comes in the name of. 2 Thessalonians 2,1
goldie silver he? she’s clearly a woman,0
@Matt manning again that's not really relevant. Even if they only address one part of the problem doesn't mean they are bad. At least they are dealing with some of it rather than just saying there's problems like Republicans and liberals,0
When the sheriff first came on the public scene many years ago,0
Madonna wouldn't be here if her mother had her attitude .,0
Liberals are for inclusion but including all lives matter is somehow.......non inclusive???  What??,0
So now it’s racist to say All Lives Matter! Hmmm 🤔!!,0
@BXNZ BXNDIT notice how no one replied/liked,0
Not cut from the same cloth... Really dude? I thought I hated reading from the age I could read till about 4 years ago. Now I read a book a day. I hated reading because I thought reading was the act of intrepeting literature like Shakespeare and understanding mathematics with a monotone teacher in the front explaining the concepts on the page. Then I realized,0
I disagree strongly. nThis makes absolutely no sense.,0
@Nomi Sunrider We're talking about the requirements of your beliefs. Meaning,0
@Pancho Mulongeni She redefined being ladylike??  I don't think so.,0
Utter morons. Marxism will kill and enslave millions. This is an international tantrum created by the media for needy low information idiots.,0
Millennial Falcon a whole 3 years later yk,0

Activists usually are not good listeners.,0
Without a leader like Gandhi to lead them with peace,0
Ummm I pictured my mom and dad so I’m not watching this video.,0
Average Murican And we now they also get killed,0
If all lives don't matter,0
ofaboosting 129 yes but doesn’t always happen most people are nice but systemic racism is still a thing,0
I'm really getting sick of BLM,0
Fair enough about time.,0
You arent the first person in this toxic comment section.,0
the question is so easy to answer the problem is the politics they take it to another lvl to take the vote of black people.,0
I wasn’t meaning anything rude by it. Butch isn’t derogatory in our community lol. It’s really only derogatory in the eyes of straight people bcuz they just don’t understand the slang. But I apologize for it.,0
Imagine if after Martin Luther King jr’s “I have a dream speech” white peoples went around shouting “all colors have a dream too” nnLike seriously 🤦‍ do you guys have to make everything about you nnnBlack peoples are trying to fight for justice by saying they matter nnAnd you white people have to come out of nowhere screaming all “lives matter” 🤦‍ seriouslynnThis fight for their justice  has nothing to do with you people and yet you sorry asses want to jump in every black protest and make it about y’allnnthats just playing white privileged right there,0
It shouldn't be contraversial. That's the entire point!!,0
Now protest against the vaccine and chlorine chicken and any other filthy plans those in power have.,0
@Dallion Coker  Adam and Eve,0
How is it going so far? I'm looking to go into engineering too!,1
This was amazing!!!,1
She so brave!! Their are those who judge the less fortunate,0
I got news for you....NONE OF YOUR LIVES MATTER...NONE. No politician cares about you unless they stand to gain from it. No life in this planet matters to me unless you are friend or family....other than that..get bent.,0
@Pho King we are all God's children.. So to me every single precious human beings life is important.. So to me it will always be 'All Lives Matter' nPeriod,1
Why would white people want to keep someone that has cause pain and hurt to thousands of Black people. WHY DO THEY MAKE HERO'S OUT OF MURDERERS AND THIEVES. THE SAME WITH CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS!  HE STARTED THIS BIG STEALING OF BLACK PEOPLE FOR PROFIT. HE ALSO DID NOT FIND ANYWHERE! THERE WERE BROWN BLACK PEOPLE LIVING IN THESE AREAS BEFORE HE AND HIS SOCIOPATHS TURNED UP.,0
TheNatureLover oh okay. Thanks for clearing that up,0
@StrudelGod you can never change DNA,0
@Ella Risa Music Official im not being mean but the pfp is horrid and evil,0
Bea Millan-Windorski thats because women prefer those jobs. a lot of the male dominated fields are jobs where you work long hours,0
As a persecuted bald man,0
this place is-,0
I wish they toss him in the canal like the statue,0
I’m pretty sure that,0
she didnt say anything wrong,0
Dude do you realize how many people get depression and comit suicide after going to conversion therapy? Is literally one of the most mental unhealthy things.,1
You can tell she wanted to say something else when she said she’d beat them with a book back,0
when she said “that’s pure mean” I LOST IT,0
now Black lives matter again,0
@Van Helsing We've had enough. We pleaded for our lives. You didn't listen. Time to act.nBlack lives matter.,0

That's right ALL LIVES MATTER!!!,1
All lives dont matter Palestinians have been getting killed by the thousands  By the Israelis soldiers and nobody cares.....,0
Idk if. I'm wierd but I never really played with dolls....I just loved playing with cars,1
@Michael Paysour  you are right about that...BLM members killing black children all over USA now...,0
Ugh that kid who doesn't agree with it got on my nervesnnYou can't disagree with something that just exists whether you like it or not,0
And before people get on my ass for this how does 'feminism' represent equality,0

Should all the castles built by the normans in Wales be demolished too this is all  ballocks,0
my life too  the Queen,0
She is saying that her beliefs don’t line up with it,0
Because it does nothing to serve the aims of the communist revolution,0
What i dont like about this interview is that she doesn't own being a heterosexual who supports the LGBTQ community. She is straight- children and all. But maybe she believes love is love. n.............. Either way lots of straight people liked her music as well. I wish all people the best. All lives matter.,1
2018 and we're still talking about gender gap in STEM. Things are changing too slowly.,1
This is the biggest overreaction in American history,0
Have you become that strong smart woman in suits designing beautiful constructions visiting the site and giving instructions to the workers yet?,1
@WerebatnI am not sure why I stated that - maybe I was thinking of another comment. Maybe it was because you say that she is not an engineer. I don't believe that you HAVE to be an engineer to encourage females to go into the field - anyone can do it. So,1
Abbie Taiyra a officer did the same thing,0
what a nice victimism battle !!,0
Congrats on graduating  I'm still in 2nd year...,0
Why the question mark?,0
This is so inspiring. I always watch this when I feel discouraged.,1
Because you are a butthurt society?????,0
Answer to video title - because It dilutes the message that Black Lives are not less than,0
How very generous of you...,0
Covid19 is so last week,0
Since the media has them all hyped up that the police are after them,0
there are still certain things that are afforded to others like the adoption thing (which is being dealt with) the addition of protections from being fired or being descriminated against for housing but by and large yes the marriage thing was the last major battle. You can't completely erase bigotry,0
Juan was a moron! And still is!,0
Madonna educates people on many things.Shes there because she’s destined for it.She does a lot of good admirable things.,1

i wouldn't bet against them changing their name after all the aggravation,0
Man all yall simple how about in America it's ok to say whatever you want to say 1st amendment seems like some 1%er somewhere is trying to control the minds into thinking that there ain't even an argument for saying anything you want to say in America come on now I can see right through this,0
@Linda B Why did you Highlight HUSSEIN?,0
Engineering on par with coding is perhaps the toughest field one could ever take. Becoming a surgeon comes second to this,0

There's something fascinating to me about a woman who's correct,1
@Finn Does Stuff you do not define a sin because a sin is something that God tells us no to do therefore it is a sin not what you think it is what God says,0
I trust this man what a man Sheriff Clarke,0
To any of you out there who think black conservatives are Uncle Toms who have sold out to Whitey,0
Only Juan doesn't make sense here. The reason is that he and most leftists are ideologically possessed. It doesn't matter how illogical or awkward their position might be,0
there's a fine line between disagreeing with them and being against them. she literally said she's alright with lgbt.,1
@Adam N. 84% success rate is amazingly Good.,0

Picture of the year gonna be a hard one,0
let’s tear down the pyramids!,0
If they tried converting psychopaths that way,0
Yeah by burning down peoples houses and killing cops... Yeah....,0
@Travelling UK you are 100% correct on that I agree with you. I just hope things get back on track with time. god bless,0
I actually like Annie more after learning that she doesnt support homosexuality because shes being open-minded and saying that its the person's choice,0
Trying to rewrite history huh good luck loln KAG FOREVER,0
Emily Larae Also saying he’ll never say black lives matter because he got bullied by a few black kids as an 8 year old is also silly.,0
Look at the comments most of them are,0
@Lela Robinson lol you corrected my english but just look at yours.nAnd concerning what you asked,0
idk if you take requests or not,0
A year later and I hope you are fulfilling your dream <3nI reported a comment and I truly hope you had not seen the remark.,1
Can we get an extended version of Marcus & Jules?,0
@nathan bucknI think a true Christian would never bless one soldier over another because they would recognize that almost all violence is unnecessary and against God's will...,0
I understand their intent of putting the focus on Black Lives Matter .   But if they want support from more people,0
Nothing is wrong with this statement.  It’s the way we all are supposed to live...loving others as God loves us.,0
Bet all the disliked are haters if blacks,0
Maybe just say which lives dont matter?,0
You can never tell on the outside unless they literally wear a shirt that says I'm lesbian or I'm a homophobe. A lot of people think I'm lesbian (I'm not but I have full respect for them),1

@FAZE ARNOLD thank you.,0
Can i just say the guy thats talkings voice is so adorable. Like even his slight speach impediment like- MY HEART HE IS ADORABLE,0
Alll on the movement  lives matter  are criminals,1
What shall we say to the woman that George Floyd held at gunpoint while his mates ransacked and robbed her house?,0
@Michael Duncan right? Everyone needs someone to point the finger at,0
Oh if I was on this show when I was a kid ohhhhhhhhh I would be OVER educated,0
I am currently looking for conversion therapy. I'm not a pusspuss like this guy. If anyone could give me some info I'd appreciate it. Have fun person in the video with your fear mongering.,0
I don’t understand why saying black lives matter is really ok. It implies that all others don’t or aren’t. If I said white lives matter do you think it would be racist? If I said Asian lives matter would that be the same? Why? I understand that police brutality is out of control and needs to be addressed,1
Also radiates HELLA GAYNESS LIKE HELLO,0
Fear Dheas that’s the point.. so the Democrats can pick weak minded majorities and lie to them for votes.. very simple,0
Love is Love!,1
@Casual Aelor omfg. All lives DO matter. But atm blm because a lot of blacks are dying as a result of police brutality and racism. If a kid gets hurt and is in need kf a bandage,0
@mi name None of that is evidence. That's all in your head. It's purely psychosomatic. It's because these ideas have been drilled into you since you were a child. And no you don't need to have a mental illness to invent these thoughts. nnAnd the fact that you dismiss other religions is also laughable. What makes you think yours is any more credible than theirs? What if THEY have the same thoughts,0
Black lives matter is racist and it self evidently shows.,0
I get so emotional watching this. I'm crying right now! We are all equal!!!,1
all of this is systematic  no it comes down to ..... this is an organization ..... when some one says  black lives matter  there saying only black lives matter!     it is a hate slogen  (only black lives matter ) not any other race so much hate .. and if you say any thing .. your a racest .... if your a rich black purson your a sell out ..... not police lives matter ..... not fire fighters matter ...... not amerian lives matter .....not baby live matter ..... hate any one that is any color ..... hate for the sake of hate ......  in other words if you live under the sun and your racest  now ask your self would this happen when obama was in office .. yes there is now way out .. where is the $ comming from that is baking the movement how are thy getting supplies ... nefarious Deeds ?,0
Funny that women engi's just had a bridge collapse killing 6,0
Shawna HiRAEth she’s not lmao,0
The Democratic Party is more dangerous to America than ISIS,1
@Logan Schmidt all lives matter is not a counterprotest is a fact,0
All Lives Matters means exactly that. Equality for everyone. BLM only focuses and try’s to elevate 1 race. I’m Asian and we too suffer from racism - especially now with this COVID-19 situation. Racism and brutality is never right. All Lives Matter.,1
The kid who said he chose to love is very smart and mature for his age to say something like that. It’s nice to see that there are still kids like that who believe in being kind to one another and not trying to fit in if it means being mean,1
as she ages she becomes more vulnerable and transparent.... <3,0

It's very sad seeing people putting them selves in previlage,0

Who is this Annie?,0
Ill be honest this speech did not inspire me. She made it seem like they don't encourage women to do well in engineering. As a Chemical Engineering student I have been nothing but supported by teachers and other classmates in my program to succeed and do well. The STEM field wants more women in the field... women just don't choose to be in the field. The majority of women want to be in other careers like teaching or business. Most of the girls that I have talked to ask me why I would want to be into a major like this. It's not a problem of women not being encouraged to be in engineering,1
Racist idiots.nnAll lives matter here in the United States. You total idiots.,0
i like that it was in toronto. i live in canada. the most racist province you can find yourself in is Alberta because its essentially the texas of canada. Toronto and British Columbia are the most diverse and inclusive places to be. while i won't say racism doesn't exist here,1
Democratic Party is most definitely whoring votes,0
Hmm they best way I can try to explain is like when someone says they don't agree with it that means they don't think it is totally ok,0
One thing i dont get is why do they have to talk like a teenage girl?,0
+Wafae Stop blaming men for women's choices of not getting into engineering and computer science.,1
LOVE the jacket she is wearing. Very Michael Jackson of her,0
Black Lives Matter & ANTIFA are used to create anarchy while police stand down so they can put them against the KKK & other extremists as it's divide & conquer by elite funding movements & groups to crash western society while we are in their curfews & martial law that is destroying our freedoms,0
Black and gay? That's a double negative,0
I would love to see black Americans in Africa considering how much i know black Africans hate other Africans,0

Sunshine littlephilly u are saying that he’s a lovely and respectful person why would he go to hell,0
I think the problem is the mentality of thinking that the two statements have to be either or the other. Why can’t specifically black lives matter too? Not matter any greater,0

I like to see statues of people who killed my ancestors in America. Same thing for English statues for people who killed the Scottish and Irish ancestors too. It's a reminder to never let it happen again.,0
idgaf what makes you think foreign workers in the Middle East are only Asian people?  Have you been to the Middle East if so you would have seen for yourself foreign workers are also from Africa.,0

OMG. rndo you really think this floyd law move is real this is not the perfect campaign of Trump's enemies. you give in to America's enemies. How can you smoke America from the inside?

Sheriff Clarke said it all in five syllables -- Lyndon B. Johnson.  Sorry they didn't let him explain ANY of it.  Listen to Candace Owens and she explains it all.  God love America's black community -- may we USE the current administration to lift ourselves up -- not elect a new one to dig us ALL deeper into this poor us / help us culture we're being pushed toward.  Good panel (except for Juan) -- wish Sean had let Sheriff Clarke say more.,0
@Meher Panchal No they dont,0
All lives matter when did black lives stop mattering,0
You’re on 3$ that she is bisexual,0
Jack Parsons exactly,1
Agreed. I grew up in a conservative household and I saw homosexuality as being bad until I was 18. Now I’m 24,1
When she said that I was shocked and thought the same thing. I didn’t know if I should say it lol thank you for saying it.,0

@Indiana Rose nWhilst I hear what youre saying..the good thing about Christianity(not to be confused with hateful American evangelism) is that it evolves..through time..scientific discovery and public debate..you know we now no longer believe the earth is flat or execute people for working on the Sabbath...now we take our advice on sexuality from experts called sexologists...not bronze age dessert tribesmen who knew nothing about the complexities and diversified of human sexuality..in the UK senior clergy are calling for some now deceased homosexuals to receive recognition and award for their good works that benefited society.,0

I legit thought she was lesbian lmfao,0
@Molly Rebekah Don't worry about these people. The devil tries everything against us. If we're receiving all of this hate it's because we're saying the truth. The truth hurts but it's the truth. God's with us.,0
Because all lives matter totally doesn't include black lives,0
All you need to do is let girls choose their own subjects. Don't make other girls have to choose what you want them too. Give them their own options. In fact I've never heard anyone tell girls that they can't choose engineering or science. Let them choose what they enjoy.,1

I could maybe be sympathetic if they were less vague. All I hear is them ascribing sinister motives to people who seem like they are just being overly friendly nerds.nAnd these testimonials right before the statstics on women engineers in Silicon Valley seem to imply that the reason that there are less women in tech there is because it is a hostile environment for women. But step in your typical engineering classroom in America and then tell me that there are as many women interested in engineering as men. A gender inbalance   does not automatically mean discrimination,1

Everyone is adoring how that one kid said 'god gave us a choice and my choice is to love',1
What still shocks me is that Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden use black culture constantly for votes and recognition.

Human beings are not doing those things they were doing in Greek mythology you have to use common sense that's not of GOD and what's not of GOD is of witchcraft also you need to listen to Pastor Derek Prince and you will learn a lot. You will want to read your HOLY  BIBLE and you will want to PRAY because GOD is using him to help others .  We lost pastor Prince  several years ago but the SPIRIT of the LORD that was in him is working in this earth helping others to learn about the ways of JESUS Christ GOD bless you,0

We meet up every year for a few days. My older cousins bring their girlfriends and every year at the end of the visit my grandparents say to me “Someday you will bring your boyfriend to be with us. We can’t wait to meet him when you get one”. It’s so awful,1

This is indoctrinating children.. does anyone not see this?,0
All lives matter and frankly from what I've seen is that gun laws in America are yet again the true problem whether out of prejudice towards the colour of skin I think it's ludicrous the chances between the rich and poor are divided and that is where the true issue is it is difficult to get rid on one bigoted billionaire that so happens to be the president of the United States but laws around the world have no difficulties ridding poor people out of the society so therefore I'm afraid that the majority is playing a dangerous game of racial anger that can result in a civil war that would not be beneficial for whatever colour of skin you've put your bets on so when I say all lives matter I mean to say,1

Suggesting Africans were all living as one big tribe. Africa is a lot bigger than Europe and has hundreds if not thousands of different ethnic groups.

Go read what Romans wrote about the British. Or how Irish,0

"`This is such a fun entry.   Devotchka  I once had a coworker from Korea and not only couldn't she tell the difference between USA-English and British English, she had trouble telling the difference between different European languages.  (Kind of keeps things in perspective, eh?) -) :Not suprising. While I can easily tell the difference between French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc., put me in a room with a Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and a Thai speaker and I probably couldn't tell the difference. (If I saw it written I'd probably have somewhat more luck though.)  SJK  Vietnamese has more syllable-final consonants than Japanese, I think you can tell them apart that way, maybe. Is this right? - Juuitchan  Someone suggested: ``Heath Robinson`` and ``Rube Goldberg`` as a vocabulary difference.  It's certainly an interesting parallel, but I don't think it really belongs here.  They were both artists with their own style, and both are known on both sides of the pond although their use as descriptive adjectives is split as suggested.  At any rate, they can't quite be considered translations, because as an adjective, ``Rube Goldberg`` is more specific, describing an overly complex mechanical device or a complex series of interdependent actions; Heath Robinson, in contrast, is more surrealistic or fantasy-oriented.  LDC  As an American, I would like to say that to me a bum is a homeless person as much as the butt, a flat is an apartment, and rubbish certainly is trash. Granted, I agree that a fag is not a cigarette, and underground is not a subway. I may do some actual research, and come back and fiddle with that list. - Eean.  :I think Americans certainly understand the use of ``bum`` for ``butt``, ``rubbish`` for ``trash``, and (to a lesser degree) ``flat`` for ``apartment``.  But we don't use those terms much.  Point to a container for discarded things, and an American will say ``that's a trash can``; a Brit will say ``that's a rubbish bin``.  Americans are more likely to use ``rubbish`` in the sense of ``bullshit``. LDC  I deleted the following pair: ``limited (Ltd)`` and ``incorporated``, since they actually mean different things. ``Incorporated`` means a corporation; ``limited`` means a limited liability corporation (you can also have unlimited liability corporations, and no liability corporations). British (and Australian also) Ltd is roughly equivalent to American LLC.  SJK  I would say 'torch' was much more common than 'pocket lamp' which sounds quite old-fashioned. 'Flashlight' would be more easily recognised than the latter.  Yes, I'd call it a ``torch``, and it would probably be labeled as a ``flashlight`` in its manufacturer's packaging. IMO, 'torch' is colloquial British English  The Anome  Oh, so ``flashlight`` is correct British usage?

"`:In an interpreted language your source code is read in command by command by a software tool, which is called the Interpreter and executed.  What ? Command-by-command ? No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw  === From Interpreted Language/Talk ===   :some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime  Could you elaborate ? Taw  Every time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it's not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15  You mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw  : I believe it's compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it's possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I'm not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley  === Old Interpreted Language article ===  An interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.  It is often a mistake to refer to a language as either ``interpreted`` or ``compiled``, because most languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime but behave as if they were interpreted. Other languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an intermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled). Some languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.  An example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.   Is Java interpreted, or what?   The Java programming language article says:  :``The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.``   The Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC  Yes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an ``eval`` statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt  Way too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of ``compiling``. It is used in two distinct meanings, as in: # compiled to machine code (or assembly) # compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation  I think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way ``compiled``. In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all ``compile`` source to some form of internal representation.  Quote from FOLDOC:      Compiler       A program that converts another program      from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to      {machine language} (object code).  Some compilers output      {assembly language} which is then converted to {machine      language} by a separate {assembler}.      ...  `",0

"`  ===Announcement=== I have compared Helga's original version and Helga's condensed version to each other as promised.  To be fair, Helga only claimed to have condensed, and not re-written the article.  in this, she is completely correct.  The problem, however, is that this condensation in no way makes the article less of a copyright violation.  As written, there is no way that this should be included on the site, IMO.  I have included the article below, with questions and comments(in bold) that I think must be answered in order to make the article useful and not just another way of trying to prove that Copernicus was Prussian.  That said, I really think that this deserves no more than a couple of lines in the Copernicus article.  Thanks all for bearing with me and helping make this work.  Helga, plese help out by answering the questions   and perhaps even doing a bit more research  so that we can work together to make this a well-written, meaninful, article.   :Copernicus as Ermland Administrator and the Prussian Coin Reform  :Nicolaus Copernicus is today world famous as Astronomer, but at home he wore many different hats. Amongst other positions he held, he was Nicolaus Copernicus Thornensis Prussus Mathematicus, the Prussian mathematician from Thorn.   This really isn't a position, I don't think  he wasn't hired as a city mathemetician.  Also, I think there should at least be some kind of connection for new readers as to how the whole Ermeland/Thorn/Prussia thing works  it is very unhelpful to assume that the reader will know that one is a city, the other a region, the other a principality, etc...  :In the Copernicus manustript an entry from December 1603 states in partial ...Nicolai Copernick Canonici Varmiensis, in Borussia Germaniae mathematici... In what manuscript? this appears to be a random comment, and doesn't make much sense    :Besides being a church canon and administering as physician to his people, Nicolaus Copernicus worked with the other Prussian states on coin reform.  Again, reference?  What Prussian states?  What does this mean in practical terms?  :The situation in Prussia as well as in other parts of Europe in the years before, during and after the Reformation became very insecure and confused.  Copernicus died in 1543  well before the Peace of Augsburg  Although this statement is correct, I'm not sure how Copernicus the church canon, physician, astronomer, etc., fits in.    :There were cities in Prussia that fought for keeping the government of the Catholic Teutonic Knights and others, who fought to get the Papal domination out and to become Protestant. During this time the crown of Poland, held by the Lithuanian Jagiello’s, married to the imperial Habsburg's had some limited influence in the politics of Prussia. Sigismund I wanted the Prussian cities to give up their right to mint coins. The leading cities of Prussia, Thorn, Danzig and Elbing declared, never would they give up their individual city rights to mint coins. Minting coins was a right given by the emperor and giving up this right would mean loss of sovereignty .   This helps to explain something about the former, in that it sets up a Catholic-Protestent conflict.  My questions:   *What cities, if any, were ruled by the Teutonic Knights at the time  or was it all of Prussia?   *Does this have something to do with either the Second treaty of Thorn or the abdication of Albrecht of Prussia from his position as Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights?  From the other info on the site, it looks like there may have been some conflict over jurisdiction between Albrecht and his heirs and the TKs, who began to get their Grand Masters by imperial appointment (and from the impreial  read Habsburg  family) *How do the Jagiellos fit in?  Is their involvement because of their distant connection to the Habsburgs, as Helga implies?  or because (as we know from other articles) at one point, residents of the area had appealed to the Polish rulers for help in overthrowing the Teutonic Knights? *'''Could the objections of the cities mentioned not have something to do with their being members of the Hansa  a group notoriously jealous of their independence and privileges?  In answer to the much-anticipated imperial comment, viz., that the objections had  to do with an infringement of imperial right and law, I cry bullshit.  The Hansa cities regularly played off their position between the emperors and other rulers  Emperors could grant them independence from local rule, but the cities fought hard to keep the emperors from having too much control.

"`  : To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV: : * Nothing ``compels`` a just God to ``enforce`` a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word ``perish`` in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather ``middle voice``, which means a better translation would be ``whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself``. Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a ``river of fire``. Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will. : * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed. : * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not. : Hope this helps.

"  ::: On the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced. The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish people’s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.  :::In the 19th century a Cockney and a Geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in England. England was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. What is England and Englishness anyway? Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I don’t see how the Cornish differ from the English.  :::Leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. The Cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of Cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise.

But today such scientists in eitehr the US or Germany can say what they want and for the most part, thanks in part to open scientific debate, and democratic societies where there is vigorous public debate in legislatures, their work has not had the same awful effect.

"`Well, I am not trying to pick a fight ) but I have NPOV issues with this article.  It reads  at the moment  like a celebration of scientific progress.  I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.    One way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.  I'd hope a good article on ``the history of science`` would inform me of these issues, and provide me with the different ways of understanding the movement from one period in science to another.    I am no expert on this but I really hope someone who feels very confident of their grasp of, say, Thomas Kuhn and Bruno Latour, could reorganize and develop this article in a way that takes their claims about science seriously, as well as the claims of those with opposing views.    I am glad Ed has begun this article, it can be really important and it is a needed contribution.   SR  `",0

On the other hand I am doing my best to compose one article from the scratch and then you come and you 'ruin' almost my whole work. Who is doing fruitless work here? You're obviously to deep in the math and you can't see out anymore. Try to read one original work from an original mathematician, please.

When I make a table, it is clear after that what values are, but try to 'calculate' its values from your mind. I gave the function to depict further on the whole subject. It is pointless; there is no connection that needs to be mentioned. That is you opinion, I guess. Everything is important in math, specially in a number theory. If I wouldn't use Möbius function I wouln't be able to find those two numbers 648 and 700. I guess here μ(n) is 'more' important than other arithmetic functions. That's my opinion. Furthermore, anyone interested in the moebius function can easily find the value, since all they have to do is to count the prime factors, which are already given in the table. Yes, that is true. But many readers do not know at first what μ(n) means and shows. Simply as that. :(6) I am not your student out there somewhere so we have to work for this project.

For instance, Lord Moyne was not much of an Arab (though they were his favorites, I guess), so his assassination by Stern gang belongs more to Israeli terrorism   * Facts about Israel (note that many of the statements on this page are disputed)  With all the due respect, I don't think this link should be applied on this page, for several reasons: # It is not about Israeli terrorism, but about general Israel-bashing # It contains mostly incomplete and partial information. For instance, the green Palestinian number plates was something they asked for. Israeli Arabs have regular yellow plates, and because of that are sometimes targeted by Palestinian gunmen. # Many of these statements deserve a proper discussion, in Wikipedia, not out of it.    - **The USS Liberty incident is generally thought to have been an Israeli mistake.  : The USS Liberty was a US Navy ship. It was flying a Navy ensign. It had guns on it. Since it wasn't civilian, engaging it at sea does not have anything to do with terrorism, and has no place on this page, which is about terrorism.      This sentence has been removed from the article about Kach. ``They have also organized murders and beatings of Palestinians in the U.S.`` : Really?  Who?    :I too am curious about this claim. It is so vague and undocumented that it does not belong in the article. Can someone provide specific claims, and a few sources for us to check out? Also, I do not understand what this has to do with the government of Israel. I agree that it is theoretically possible for a few fanatic right-wing American Jews to carry out such a thing. But (A) there is only a vague allegation being made, and (B) this has nothing to do with the Israeli government, nor the pre-Israel proto-state in the British Mandate of Palestine. We can't simply lump all crimes done by Jewish people into the category of ``Israeli terrorism``. All crimes committed by Arabs considered Palestinian terrorism (No.).   Unless these acts were committed by agents of the government of Israel, why are they listed as ``Israeli terrorism`` instead of ``Jewish terrorism``?  ~~  I'd tend to agree with Zoe here about the title of the article being wrong. Since it's so ``controversial`` coming up with a universally-acceptable definition of ``terrorist`` vs. ``freedom fighter``, maybe we should just have ``Violence against Israelis`` and ``Violence against Palestinians`` pages, or some such?  : Such pages exist (at least for Palestinians), but nobody bothers to update them. It's much less sexy than ``Israeli terrorism``.   Then maybe this should redirect to ``Violence against Palestinians`` (after moving the content of this page & its Talk there, of course)?  The page I had in mind was Palestinians killed by Israelis, but I support leaving ``X terrorism`` pages, because of the difference between spontaneous violence and pre-calculated killing, which is terrorism.   :Actually, I was thinking of very neutral titles (such as the ``violence`` ones above), chucking in all the text from any non-NPOV-titled articles scattered about (they can be smoothed out later) and redirecting to the neutral-titled articles. It should make NPOV easier to maintain. I'd lose the ``terrorism`` pages entirely in the process (dumping their text & talk into the new articles), as we're never going to agree on which acts are ``terrorism`` and which are not (and you know we're not, yeah?). If the articles just give the facts then we can leave ``terrorism or not?`` decisions up to the readers.  :: Having considered the concept, I support it.

"    Let me respond again.  I usually get a l lot of negative reaction when I introduce something with which lay readers are not familiar.   I don’t have a pro-dictator bias. It just seems like that because I’m correcting articles that were already one-sided. History's not a pros and cons analysis anyway. Historians want to know why and how.   Also, I don’t use one explanatory model (like Marxism, World Systems Theory, Dependency Theory, Modernization Theory, etc.) solely. I don’t keep my mind closed to one interpretation.   If an article chronicles any facts, I leave them if they’re accurate. But they must be explained in a context. Statements like ‘he’s an authoritarian dictator bent on staying in power at all cost rejected by the international community’ will go in favor of statements like ‘because of his controversial policies he’s been ejected from the Commonwealth at Britain’s behest'.   If an article mentions that Mugabe has been seizing white-owned farms it must also mention that 4,500 white farmers own 70% in the land in a country of 13 million. The article must also explain why land reform is a touted goal in the Third World. To many, that unacceptable because that's pro-Mugabe POVing. But quoting anti-Mugabe insults by as many famous people as possible is possible because it's a fact that they said those things.   Some can’t tolerate that. To them, Mugabe persecutes homosexuals; he’s a racist; he subverts democracy; he cracks down against NGOs; he rigs elections; he’s unmitigated evil; and he does that because he’s evil.   There are not that many social historians who would accept such simplistic, sweeping conclusions based on superficialities.    ",0

"oh the classic SM/DF response. That was only one of a range of clumsy stupid errors added into the article. For example, we put the first title held by a monarch first. James was James VI of Scotland long before he became James I of England. So everyone agreed that that was the order they should be in. But in typical SM/DF style it was decided, 'screw everyone else's agreement, I am going to unilaterally change it. (Like Adam tried to screw up naming conventions, and even when voted down still ignored the decision and did it Adam's way, leaving everyone else to rename articles and clear up the mess by returning things to the agreed formula.   Second, there was a long long long debate about when to describe a modern monarch as British. It was agreed to apply it to after 1707. But Adam decided to ignore the long debate and do it his way, his way on the naming of election pages (who cares if everyone else uses a totally different system and votes down his suggestion!), his way on referring to peers, his way on using the word British, on how to describe James VI/I, his way now on the History of the Soviet Union, his way on how names on a list should appear (the different way to everyone else's, he unilaterally changing lists to suit what he wanted, even when everyone else screamed 'what the hell are you doing'.  Other people put a lot of work into getting a consensus. Adam ignores the consensus and does it the way he wants. And gets miffed when people end up undoing his garbled stuff and return things to the agreed way.  Yes there has been an improvement, cp. DF was actually nice to work with for about 4 days, then suddenly became an ogre on idolatory and various other pages. The immediate reaction was 'oh God, here we go again'. Even Mav let out a sigh about DF's behaviour, and Mav doesn't normally do that. Most of us are fed up trying to explain to SM/DF where they are wrong, only to be ignored and blatently untrue rubbish dumped into articles. So we aren't been called rascists and nazis, big deal!

"`:: Hmm, Thinking about it, getting involved in a more elaborate argument around the question the question of rigor or lack-there-of is fairly useless. To me, the SI's dismissal of Black Mask seems like a ideal example of rigor but I suspect we'd disagree about a lot. I'll boil the general argument down to the point that the intended mission of wikipedia is producing a neuteral summary of generally agreed facts about historically significant actors, in this case the SI. The question of Debord's dictatorial control is clearly a partisan position, therefore it should hardly be presented prominently (though it's certainly a fact the many have claimed this). The split with the Nashists was *A* significant event during period of development of the Situationists. But to call it *THE* significant event is to make earlier development of group more important than the latter development. Debord and Sanguinetti's book ``The Real Split In The International`` could just as well be called the ``fundamental split`` if you took later Situationist developments as more important. Naturally, a neuteral account would take neither position - it could still mention one or both.  ::Your claims that my lack of interest in the Nashists represent anti-Scandinavians racism might perhaps be considered another instance of your humor, perhaps? In anycase, the studies of the SI that come to mind are Sadie Plant or Len Bracken. Even Greil Marcus has some useful stuff. Indeed, in the clearly partisan Bob Black essay the introductory paragraphs still winds-up with a somewhat more balanced view of the group than the current entry here (though clearly there's still a ``revive the honor of forgotten Second Situationist Internation`` thing going on).  ::In anycase, I reviewed the history of text and it seem that the first or two paragraphs are essentially tacked-on afterwards. This explains the disjointed quality of the text as a whole - it clearly needs rewriting.  ::As far as links go, certainly inclusive links are another option - it is simply that the entry would have to be vastly MORE inclusive than the present entry if you wanted to include all links to comments and critiques on the Situationists.       `",0
"`    Another thought - is describing the word as a ``neologism`` superfluous, perhaps? I've always been an advocate of approaching writing a Wikipedia article as if everything you're writing about happened a thousand years ago and is ancient history, because it seems to me that's the proper style for an encyclopaedia, which is intended to be timeless and authoritative. ``Neologism`` is an inescapably relative word - *all* words are neologisms looked at from one perspective in time, soon after they are invented. (All the words Shakespeare invented would be neologisms if you lived in 1630, for instance). I sincerely hope this page will be around in some form in another hundred years, at which point homophobia will no longer be a neologism.

"   Hi Eric, no. You are not in any way one of the people I was talking about. You just got caught in the crossfire, and if I made you think I was thinking of you I apologise. Your work is consistent good plus even more importantly, you have a sensitivity to other people's work with a few people don't. You build on their work to produce something that improves in quality. The people I was talking about arrive at an article, chop it around, change meanings, change context, spelling, capitalisation and then move on, more often than not without giving the slightest suggestion that they actually knew what they were doing.   For example, one guy when he comes across the word taoisigh which is the gaelic plural for taoiseach and which is explained as such on its first mention in some articles, frequently changes it to taoiseachs, a non-existent word. He has tried to change governors-general to governor-generals, Prime Minister to Prime minister. He changed links from President of Ireland to President of Ireland, links to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (ie the form of UK between 1901 and 1922) to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, so linking the reference to the wrong UK. He mucked up some links to Tánaiste (deputy Irish prime minister) by lower-casing it, changed a series of mentions of First Lady when referring to a specific first lady to lowercase first lady, changed one mention of Garret FitzGerald to Garrett Fitzgerald, removed the word Óg from Gearóid Og Fitzgerald and Mór from Gearóid Mór Fitzgerald, not grasping that they actually were two different people (Mór = big in gaelic and indicated the father, Óg meaning small meant his son) and ended up turning an article that mentioned them both into gobbledigook. That is just some of my work he has mucked up. He made a complete mess of some biology articles, reduced an article on mediæval history to such a degree of unreadability that the author, one of the world's top mediæval historians, quick wiki in disgust. I know at least six people who have left wiki over his actions. And there are quite a few such people. Not a lot, but enough to mangle everything they touch. Another contributor constantly changed an elementary fact in 18th century history on the basis of google searches. I checked on google. The majority of articles said he was right. Those google searches turned up stuff that were barely of high school standard. But she treated google as sacrosanct. If a google search said it, it was gospel.   I have had political science articles which I have written and which were based on hard fact, in mediocre garbage, applying wrong capitalisation (again based on google searches that largely threw up high school essays), wrong spelling, wrong interpretation, etc. I wasn't reacting simply to the Droop Quota at all (that was the sixth article that day I had done that had been 'hit'. In that case Michael Hardy as he is prone to do, swept in to a topic he knows little about, changed capitalisation, text and even the formula which is the standard DQ formula taught (in that form because as already happened in the discussion on the talk page, if you leave out the parentheses people muck up the order of the calculation and so get the wrong formula). That intervention was classic Michael; go onto a page about a topic he doesn't know much about and instead of asking why it is written like that, unilaterally change it, in most cases producing a version that is so wrong it would be savaged if any student repeated it in a class.  American english and British English use different approaches to capitalisation. Many of the references were to things only found outside the US and so capitalised. Instead he insisted on applying US capitalisation rules to things whose capitalisation is a result of their existence and usage in parts of the world outside the US. That indeed is one of the reasons why google should never be used in checking capitalisation. Apart from its general unreliability, most website mentions in the US are created by people who automatically and incorrectly apply US capitalisation to things that don't exist in the US and are capitalised internationally. A classic example is the electoral system PR.STV (Proportional Representation using the Single Transferable Vote). Michael insisted on lowercasing it on the basis on a google search. PR.STV isn't used in the US and is generally capitalised when referring to the specific voting system, and lowercased when used generically. Where it is mentioned on google, it is largely on the basis of Americans writing about it and downcasing it to suit American english. So Michael unilaterally mucked up the capitalisation, then another US user moved the page to another name that refers to a somewhat similar but not the same electoral system more widely known in the US. So any non-American user would get r",0

"`  :Freud's ideas are certainly much discussed today, and I would be the first to agree that they must be grappled with and dealt with seriously, if only because of their currency.  So Freud deserves a long and thorough article in Wikipedia.  I believe that a balanced article would include A) explanations of Freud's theories, and B) the status of Freudianism today.  The existing article is quite thorough on ``A`` and had almost nothing on ``B``.  A neophyte who read the article as it stood a month ago would imagine that Freud's work has the same relation to current psychology that Darwin's work has to current biology.    :Let's compare them:  Darwinism thoroughly permeates modern biology, and his fundamentals, built on copious observation and collegial collaboration, now much extended with new data and new theories, continue to provide accurate predictions and fruitful avenues of exploration.  Freud's fundamental ideas were founded on minimal and dubious observations, and his theories do not meet the test of being logical, minimal, reproducible explanations of the data.  As far as Jung goes, I haven't gotten to him yet  ), and I don't know anything about Maslow.  Freud draws my fire precisely because he is so high profile, so influential, and so wrong.  I was required to study The Interpretation of Dreams in high school as if it were scientific fact, and the disgust I felt when I later realized it was all as stupid as it sounded has turned me into - yes - a Freud critic.

And, for those wars that resulted in a great deal of change to military technology, either because they were very long (like the Hundred Years' War) or very intense (like WWI or WWII), we should discuss technological escalation as a separate topic, more abstract than the equipment and tactics, less abstract than history and strategy.

They used to be a cheerful sight flying over our school in hemel hempstead when I was a kid - always turned my head to watch whenever they went over, though the 1-11s in particular were hard to avoid as they were so noisy!

"  == A couple of explanations ==  Because I am pretty new to this project and was invited by the Wikipedia policy just to step in and make some edits, I would like apologize for failing to communicate with you effectively, and to clarify a couple of things:  1) I have made in the recent days some substantial contributions and modifications to the Silesia article that I felt would be valuable to the internet readers. I din't expect that some of this changes will meet with such a fierce resistance.  2) These contributions were based on my deep knowledge (in my opinion) and serious studies into the history and modern times of Silesia. My intention was to write about facts and not about opinions, and to avoid any nationalistic bias of any kind.  3) I am very seriously touched that people who introduce most of the chaos and natiolistic bias to this article are the first to accuse others of vandalism and extreme nationalism.      == My suggestion: let's write what Silesia is now ==  The Silesia article DO need some serious improvement if we want it to be the valuable and reliable resource for the internet users. The current (restored and protected) version contains so many errors that it will chase away people with basic historical knowledge, if it's not changed as soon as possible.  1) First I suggest that we write what Silesia is now (as this is most interesting to the reader), and not what is was in the past. Silesia rich history should be discussed in the history section.  2) It is unacceptable to state that Silesia lies between Odra and Vistula rivers. First look at any map will show you that Silesia lies along the Odra river.  3) Silesia lies today in Poland and Czech Republic. It is doubtful if the Goerlitz area is part of Silesia. It is a historical part of Lusatia, and was joined to the Silesian province after 1816.  4) Im my opinion we should not discuss Silesian history in the intro paragraph, but we decide to, it is unacceptable to mention only the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation  5) I do not care in what order the language-names of Silesia are mentioned, but I do insist that the Silesian version (Ślónsk, Ślunsk) is included in this list.   6) I do insist that the various nationalities and ethnic groups living know in SIlesia, are mentioned clearly and the list should include at least: the Silesians, the Poles, the Germans, the Czechs  7) The theories about the name of the region must be clearly marked as theories and not as facts. The passages need some minor rewrite.  8) The remarks about HRE overlordship in 1146 and 1163 are simply false, no longer upheld by the German historians, and must be removed  9) Great care must be taken when dealing with Silesian history, for example the rude remarks about devastation was caused by Hussite rebellion must be rewritten using neutral words  10) The Silesia article need more sections on the People, Economy, Culture, Education, Science and Tourism.

"`   ===Pfortuny on Pfortuny's mediation===  Apologies for the delay and for the following text which is far too long and I think out of place, but the discussion has led us here. By no means I intend my opinion to be regarded as more important than any other's, but for obvious reasons some people are expecting it. Here it goes. The history of this text is in  which I shall clear this evening. The text ends at ``EOT`` below.    After reviewing the history and talking to , I have got the following vision of the facts (which is the basis for my opinion expressed below): *Alex's editions on the 29 were done without discussion on the talk page. This was clearly a serious mistake which led to the first catastrophe, but I think we may assume good faith here, at least ingnorance, not malice, especially if one follows the summaries, diffs, etc...  *Alex's editions on the 9 and 10 November were done using the talk page but he made edits before discussing them and, given the complete history of the article, the edits were too bold to be accepted without previous discussion; this led to their being systematically reverted (which is common use in the WP for that behaviour) and in the end to the blocking of the page. This behaviour was clearly a mistake of Alex's, and I put it to his not having read the complete history. While I am not excusing him, I do believe that most of the problems were a result of confusion caused by his Asperger's Syndrome. *Nobody can agree ``not to make unilateral edits`` (Adam's expression) in whatever page for whatever reason, this is a bit too generic and has no deadline. *He is aware of the damages he may incur in (damages for himself) if he repeats the above behaviour. *Before Viajero's suggestion, Alex had told  he was going to ``try to stay out of Mother Teresa's page for a while``. He has privately told me he is not going to touch the criticism section al least for a fortnight. *It sounds nice to be a mediator, but on the other hand it is a responsibility I cannot (I mean cannot, not do not want to or do not like to) take up for the moment. *If Alex behaves like he did on the 9/10 November, I will also agree to any rational punishment. I want to stress that I was in disagreement with most of his edits. *I do not think that Alex will cause any further problems.  Before stating my opinion, I would like everybody to know that Viajero's suggestion on my mediation was done without either mine or Alex's prior consent. He later expressed his concern about this to . I feel it is only fair to mention it here.  Hence, my opinion is: :Unblock the page. If Alex behaves in a non cooperative way, then the resources of Wikipedia to prevent this non cooperative behaviour will be used, as with any other user.  But I mean as with any other user. If he were going to appear in the problem page, he has to be told in his talk page in advance; if he were going to be banned, then he has to be told explicitly in his own page and by a sysop, or whatever the standard procedure is.    ::I have read the above and agree with Pfortuny.

"  Danny, I would be very happy to have their view expressed as well. Here you/we are saying that Josephus is biased.  On the Jesus page, he is noted as a being reliable. Perhaps it depends strongly on what is being said about whom, though I do not know this is necessarily the case. It does not dismiss them, they are still real and present.  The question as to descent could be answered rather well via DNA testing of their Priests and Levites  as well as mitochrondrial DNA testing. But there is risk, the desired results might not be obtained.   Would this meet the need:  :The Samaritans have insisted that they are direct descendants of the Northern Israelite tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, who survived the destruction of the Northern kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians in 722 B.C.E. The inscription of Sargon II records the deportation of a relatively small proportion of the Israelites (27,290, according to the annals), so it is quite possible that a sizable population remained that could identify themselves as Israelites, the term that the Samaritans prefer for themselves.  :Samaritan historiography would place the basic schism from the remaining part of Israel after the twelve tribes conquered the land of Canaan, lead by Joshua. After Joshua's death, Eli the priest left the tabernacle which Moses erected in the desert and established on Mount Gerizim, and built another one under his own rule in the hills of Shilo (1 Sam 1:1-3; 2:12-17). Thus, he established both an illegitimate priesthood and an illegitimate place of worship.  According to this description, the Jews are the dissidents!  ",0

"`  == Copied from Blue Ball == (The issues of this language are unrelated to disambiguation, but should be consistent with the article Blue balls.)  The following appears on Blue Ball but is more efficient to discuss here: :``Blue balls`` is a modern slang term for a minor cramping men may get in the groin after they are sexually stimulated for a prolonged period but do not ejaculate.  21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)  Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary conforms to common sense usage in saying a cramp is ``a painful spasmodic muscular contraction``, and the groin does have muscles.  But blue balls is not a cramp, but an ache in the testicles (whose musculature is insignificant at most).  Ellis emphasizes ``congestion``, which i take to imply that the pain reflects failure to release the eleveated local blood pressure resulting from failure to relieve the engorgement of the genitals that is crucial to erection, i.e., a condition related to the ``pain and tenderness`` of priapism.  (It may be informative to consult side-effects information of Viagra and its competitors, some of which are effective for 3 days and advise medical care for erections lasting over 4 hours.)  21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)  Further, the term ejaculate, like the earlier ``release semen`` (that a well-intentioned editor  used to replace simply ``release``), misleadingly suggests that fluid pressure of seminal fluid is at issue; i think research will show that there is no significant seminal pressure except that imposed in pulses by the prostate during ejaculation.  The real issue is indeed plain ``release``, or rather release of either sympathetic or parasympathetic (never could remember which is which) nervous-system excitation, which in turn entails destimulation of sphincter-like structures that sustain the engorgement (and that ED-medications work by affecting).  21:28, 2004 Mar 16 (UTC)`",0

"` This article is now considerably less lame than a month ago. However, the problem I still have with it is that the way the various POVs are presented implies that the fate of the peace process depends on the goodwill of the Palestinians, which appears uncertain, and hence Israel is the victim of their apparent duplicity. Let's be real: Israel is the occupying force here and has far, far greater military might (not to speak of economic power). The Palestinians are virtually mendicants. Hence it is ludicrous to quote Faisal Husseini calling for ``the liberation of all Palestine from the river to the sea`` without placing it within the governing geopolitical reality: Israel is armed to the teeth, backed by the even more powerful USA, and has between 200 and 400 nuclear warheads.   :Your anti-Israel political rant is of no help here.

Signing is done when you are editing a 'talk' page. When you are having a discussion it really helps to know who said what, and when. We always encourage people to sign whatever they write there. However in articles everything is considered 'common property'. We don't sign what we write, because we don't want to think that we 'own' it in any way; someone might come along and change it later. Once an article has been in existence for more than a few days there are usually many people who have contributed to it. In some cases there may be nothing left of what the first author wrote.  What a lot of people do is put a list of articles that they have made big contributions to on their own user page. That gives you an idea of what a person has done here without claiming 'ownership'.

"`  OK, when I refreshed my memory by looking at a map, I realized that Elliott Bay and Lake Washington squeezing in in the middle is probably at least 60% of the problem, so I generalized it some, although it's now a little wordier. Basically, at least for a straight road (ie following the grid), it's pretty much limited to the area of the Montlake Cuta street between Lake Union and Portage Bay would run into the Duwamish, adding the cost of a second bridge. And, indeed, if you include Lake City Way, and MLK Way, 23rd/25th does indeed come closest to qualifying (as connecting N boundary to S). (I don't feel strongly about having the explanation here, I just added it to answer the question that I thot many readers would have.)  As for Madison being the only E<>W, the offset downtown grid doesn't help, bodies of water play a part, tho' not as much (even tho' the Duwamish is generally narrow enuf for a bridge, there aren't going to be many built). Hills probably do make up most of the rest of the reason (at least besides the fact the probably no one really made it a goal). I assume the reason Madison does is related to the ferry it used to serve that crossed Lake Washington, tho' I don't know offhand which came first. (Yesler probably would also be one, except the for the hill on the east end.)  PS I like your additions to the layout article (I don't have any Seattle/King County street maps down here [but ordered a King Co Thomas Guide earlier today], so I was mostly going from memory about which cities, although I should have remembered Shoreline, since I lived there a few years, and Mercer Island, since my dad worked there about 20 yrs), and THANK YOU for fixing ``road label``I knew it was bad, but was having a mental block as to how to fix it.

Also, in a formal debate, character attacks are considered bad form.  And prejudice certainly isn't considered an argument. In fact, it often causes one to believe and say things that are not true, as Wile has pointed out.    (Me)Evidently, English is not your mother tongue, so I can forgive you in misunderstanding that ``Delete with prejudice`` does not refer to you, but to the article. I have spent some time observing your efforts to create articles which lack the barest semblance of connection to current mathematical research, and to be extremely rude to other Wikipedians when they quite reasonably ask for reliable references and sources. What I know of your work tells me that, even if there is some sense to what you posit, it lacks any context with which to connect to contemporary mathematical thought. It therefore constitutes, at best original research, which is explicitly unacceptable here, and at worst, what I will call delusional thought. It therefore has, in my opinion, no place in Wikipedia at this time, if ever. As I said earlier, call us after the Nobel is awarded.

Too independent of a specific agenda.   :::This leaves the Dems as the only broadly based party, but remember that old saw about belonging to no organized party, I'm a Democrat.

"`  (Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.  Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern ``Slavic`` and ``Dalmatian`` histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).  Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.  The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc",0

"  If you remove this article OK, but still I doubt that you catch the most general aspect of curvature in the sense of Nomizu, Kulkarni and other modern writers. Look at the reference  where you find more references. In the references there (look also that one in Lecture Notes in Mathematics) you find a decomposition of the space of all curvature structures in terms of Lie and Jordan algebras. And you find how elegantly electrodynamics and gravitational waves fit into the curvature play, look at the basic work of Lichnerowics. As an ,algebraiker' I like to write the curvature structure in the following triple form, generalizing the concept of Lie triples (the book of Otmar Loos is a nice generalization of Lie theory): [x,y,z]=R(x,y)z. This concept generalizes the notion of a Lie triple to that one of a curvature triple, where only the Jacobiidentity is missing, but a reference to the bilinear form <,> is added in such a way, that R(x,y) is an element of the pseudoorthogonal Lie algebra. Note that the complete work of Ricci, Einstein and Weyl can be summarized as a decomposition of the space of curvature structures of Levi type (for Lie algebras). All this shows, that we do not yet understand this curvature space completely. Especially the gravitational wave aspect needs clarification. Hannes Tilgner",0

"`  : It would be useful if you dated your comments, it's much easier to follow the dates that way, rather than checking the history. I agree with Rjstott for the purpose of Wikipedia. AN, whoever you are, you are surely a person whith a scientific background. You certainly don't need this article in Wikipedia to explain the centripetal force. I wrote the following paragraph in the article:  ::It is important to understand right from the start that there is no 'default', 'natural' centripetal force. By default, objects tend to move in a straight line, as Newtonian mechanics teaches, away from the 'orbit', so in this context, by default there is only a centrifugal force at work. The centripetal force is being applied either by accident (meteors orbiting a planet) or artificially (satellites orbiting Earth, the object at the end of a rope etc). Therefore, the centrifugal force is a natural component of a circular movement, while the centripetal force is what we conventionally call the force keeping the object 'in orbit'.  : That paragraph has since been removed in favor of a more scientific approach. While I can agree that the statements in my explanation might have been misleading or imprecise from a scientific perspective (which is why I didn't revert the subsequent changes), I think they are a lot easier to understand by the person who needs to be explained how the centripetal/centrifugal forces work intuitively. Again, I will not fight for that paragraph, but I would like to see something easier to understand for the casual reader in the introduction.  : Let me explain what I mean with my ``intuitiveness`` concern by using the following example: When a kid spins a rock at the end of rope he intuitively feels the centrifugal force. You will say that's not correct, he is applying the centripetal force, that's what he feels. But by that standard it would be difficult to explain gravity  following the same rationale, when you lift a suitcase you apply ``antigravity`` to it. However, the kid will intuitively feel that he's ``beating`` some force; when you explain that the downward force is called gravity and it's real, he's ready to accept that, although he's applying an upward force himself. People intuitively feel the force they need to ``beat`` as the real force; the force they apply feels like the artificial part of the equation: the upward force to beat gravity is artificial, the gravity keeping the suitcase on the ground is natural. If you explain things the other way around, you confuse the casual reader.

"`  Potential and kinetic are a very general classification of energy forms. As stated in the present version of the article, these are mostly useful in mechanics. Based on the fact that a photon has no mass, the equations that are given in the present definition of kinetic energy are not applicable to electromagnetic radiation. I must say I agree with Andries. Also, this article is part of an encyclopedia. Why should it be limited  to the basic definitions of kinetic and potential energy forms and I see no reason why we are trying to associate energy forms as to being only potential or kinetic. I like the work done by Bensaccount, but I think it needs to be elaborated. Electrical energy, for example, has both forms of potential and kinetic energies. According to ``Principles of science``, 1966, the most common forms of energy are mechanical energy, chemical energy, heat energy, sound energy (compressional waves), light energy (electromagnetic radiation), electrical energy and nuclear energy.

"   It was not my intent to editorialize the article on Marcel Lefebvre, but I was trying to correct and add some information about him.  I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.

"`   == Pro-Gay Bias? == To be honest, I am not sure I entirely follow. What is exactly is meant by holding a ``pro-gay bias``? That I am in favour of homosexuality? This seems entirely nonsensical, and indeed strictly speaking to be ``pro-gay`` would mean you hold that it is a superior sexual orientation that all should aspire to. To be quite honest, I think the whole notion of a ``pro-gay bias`` is entirely homophobic, and used to paint those who accept different sexual orientations in a manner that suggests they desire to promote homosexuality. Clearly, the article has a distinctly homophobic bias. It portrays a homosexuality as abnormal and deviant, homosexuality as a ``post-industrial`` cosmopolitan lifestyle, and homosexuality as the social norm. These are all strongly homophobic POVs which are rejected by those who accept different sexual orientations (i.e., the majority of society in the West, and specifically progressives and social liberals). Those who hold such beliefs are indeed social conservatives who defend traditional morality and particularly heterosexual relationships. Stating the views of social-conservatives as objective facts, without even engaging with the beliefs of the majority of society who accept homosexuality, is clearly and irrefutably extremely biased. As is the implication that homosexuality has supposedly ``increased``  as a result of the  ``modern urbanity of the post-industrial age``, when in fact it is irrefutably due to the increasing acceptance of people's sexualities that has occurred in Western society in the 20th Century. On these grounds, I intend to revert this article.  `",0

"` issues, because these ones are unlikely to be resolved through discussion, and are usually very demanding on the MC members.  However, issues between users, such as Wik, Theresa, 172, VV etc... are typically issues that should go through mediation before going through arbitration.  It seems people are totally forgetting the procedure of dispute resolution as suggested some time ago. Arbitration is about punishment, mediation is a soft way to achieve dispute resolution between participants. It is a gentler way to resolve a conflict. And it is also meant to be more gentle on others participants as it is a private solution, which do not force users to see an ugly display of accusations, threats, insults and generally speaking attacks between users, as we can see these days here and on the mailing lists.   I have a problem with this. The MC basically finds itself plagued by trolls, and good participants just plainly refuse mediation. So, how useful is the mediation committee ?   I'd like to mention something. In real life, people are more willing to accept mediation because there is a cost to arbitration that does not exist with mediation. This cost is in particular that * arbitration is a long process * arbitration is costly * arbitration is sometimes unfair  I wonder if any arbitration on Wikipedia should not have a *cost* to all those involved. Apart from very specific cases of troll handling, most conflicts between regular participants are *not* due to only one party. If arbitration was more costly, perhaps participants would be more willing to discuss first, before heading to punishement. Perhaps should they be a cost, whatever the outcome ? Perhaps should the decision taken by the AC more costly in case there was refusal to discuss ?    I believe that the concept of formal mediation here at Wikipedia has been a failure thus far.  This isn't entirely the mediators' fault, but rather a process and structure problem.  Contributing factors include: * Mediation is being considered too late in the conflict cycle.  Once positions have been staked out, publicly and in permanent media, mediation is much more difficult. * To be effective, mediators must have unimpeachable respect.  Real-world mediators are retired judges, former statesmen, former heads of corporations.  They are effective in part because they are perceived to have discretion, and balance.  The parties they serve believe they will act predictably and fairly.  The committee at present includes some members not known for this.  Moreover, Wikipedians as a rule do not extend ``unimpeachable respect`` to much of anyone (due to the nature of the culture here). * Mediation requests are presently public.  They should not be (c.f. MeatBall:GetARoom), since it leads to playing to the court. * Process is ``not yet fully decided`` (Wikipedia:Mediation Committee), which discourages people who could, potentially, be helped; indeed, the mediation-releated pages have an unfinished, essay-like feel to them overall. * Some private discussion amongst the mediators themselves might help in this regard (GetARoom again), since it is more difficult to reach consensus in a MeatBall:fishbowl.  The WP community should get over its ``all discussions public and archived forever`` fetish, which is disfunctional.  Consider the success of the IRC channel (which is more private than the wiki or the ML). * There are inappropriately informal expectations of the mediators themselves (``Mediators are independant in their choice of whose case to mediate, and how to mediate.``  Wikipedia:Mediation Committee) while there are rigid and overbroad rules for those who they serve (``You will then have to agree both on a mediator,`` ``The mediator will check your motivation as regards mediation,`` * It may be necessary to send some people to mediation.  I can think of several cases where contributors could, appropriately, be asked by the community to discontinue their edits to an article or group of articles until mediation is complete.  Lots of real-world success with this. * We have a problem with some articles where carefully-crafted compromises are undone by editors who weren't involved in the original compromise, which prevents healing.  I know of no good way around this, but obseve that it is a barrier to successful mediation.  I believe that the concept of formal mediation here at Wikipedia has been a failure thus far.  This isn't entirely the mediators' fault, but rather a process and structure problem.  Contributing factors include: * Mediation is being considered too late in the conflict cycle.

"`  == IPA - what ==  I read the main page of the article on IPA. On the plus side it is clear. On the minus side, it makes no attempt to explain what the IPA is.  (context, scope, purpose, etc.) Nice chart.  Lots of data (for people who probably have no need of it) but virtually no general information. My questions (which weren't answered - keep in mind I'm a totally lay person): An alphabet is used to 1.  Communicate between a writer and a reader (of the same language), 2.  Describe that communication (unambigously?)  Right?  Certain things are implied by its name, but clearly one should define what the subject of the alphabet is (are).  I have no idea if it covers all indoeuropean languages not to mention Mandarin Chinese (etc.)? Does it (attempt) to cover all spoken languages? Written?  What about non-vocal languages (finger snaps - all that stuff).  Sign-language?  We now have some evidence that hand gestures are linked to language in the brain...but I digress.  From a simplistic point of view language can be thought of as being three distinct (context sensitive) types of communication: written/read, spoken/heard and performed/viewed.  I suppose an alphabet can't cover the last (but see how choreographers describe dance) and, obviously, there are non-alphabetical languages (pictographics, heiroglyphic, etc.) just as there are languages which make use of whistles, clicks.  SO what does the IPA do?

"`  ::The Ezekiel passage is quoted in the Moloch article in the 1899 Encyclopædidia Biblica as the strongest evidence for the theory that the offerings were considered to be to Yahweh (along with Jeremiah 7.31). Both passages are also cited in the Moloch aritlce in the 1908 Catholic Encyclopedia which reponds rather weakly (in my opinion): ``But this position is to say the least improbable. The texts appealed to may well be understood otherwise, and the prophets expressly treat the cult of Moloch as foreign and as an apostasy from the worship of the true God.`` It is cited in  1911 Encyclopædia Britannica: Moloch] with the comment: ``Note, also, the attitude of Ezekiel in xx. 25 seq., 31, references which cannot be explained away.`` The article The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Molech; Moloch] treats it rather strangely, remarking:That this prophet regarded the practice as among the ``statutes that were not good, and ordinances wherein they should not live`` (Ezekiel 20:25) given by God to His people, by way of deception and judicial punishment, as some hold, is highly improbable and inconsistent with the whole prophetic attitude toward it. ::It is not clear what this means, quoting parts of the passage and paraphasing part of it and then adding ``as some hold``. This article shows itself elsewhere quite aware of the theory that infants were sacrificed to Yahweh. It also brings in bogus Moloch-worship in connection to Carthage. Not a good article in any case.  ::Three different Rabbinical interpretations of the Ezekiel passage appear at . The interpretation by Rashi accords with the most obvious meaning, disliked by TRS, but the writer finds this inconvincing as not in accord with his own theology and prefers another interpretation. That would not be a reason to suppress Rashi's interpretation and the writer does not do so.  ::There is a discussion at  which covers in part John Day's treatment favorably but also discusses the Ezekiel passage in respect to the problem of the people's belief (and apparently Ezekiel's beliefs) that commands which Ezekiel saw as bad came from Yahweh. Note, John Day believes Moloch is not Yahweh, but that still does not answer the problems with that passage.  ::In short, the passage has been long used in support of the theory that the offerings of children lmlk was understood as commanded by Yahweh. It has long been in general a problem pasage. But those who feel that it is being misinterpreted do not suppress it. It is dishonest to present a theory that has been held and still is held and suppress its strongest supporting argument. On could respond by citing the Catholic Encyclopedia response (which seems to me weak). But add it with a citation if you will. But do not suppress.  ::The inclusion is not editorializing by me. I am presenting various theories that are held along with evidence for and against. The Ezekiel passage is cited as part of a common argument that children were sacrificed to Yahweh and normally used as support for that argument, indeed one of the main sources for that argument. My own POV, as much as I have one, is that the evidence is confused, there are good arguments as well as weaknesses in various positions, and that one should present all sides ... though of course full discussion would be a book length article.   Your particular POV on a Biblical passages is not grounds to suppress it when cited with a different interpretation, especially when it is normally cited in the Moloch context by sources usually considered reputable, sometimes very much supporting the POV that the sacrifices were to Yahweh. Even when when that interpretation is rejected the Ezekiel passage is still cited in discussion.  I don't believe that anything I have included in this article, including the Ezekiel passage, is non-standard for discussion of Moloch. I have tried to present the vanilla arguments and give enough information to allow them to be understood. One obviously cannot agree with all sides. Moloch cannot easily be at once Yahweh, an entirely different god, the name of a kind of sacrifice. Passing through fire cannot be at the same time a human sacrifice or an initiation ceremony. But people do hold different views and the task of the article is to explain these views and give their history.  It should be obvious now that your original feeling that this material was novel was incorrect. Please let the normal statements used as arguments stand, regardless of the positions.  I am restoring the passage with some reasonable weasel words to make it clearer that this is the expound",0

"`Hello!  Am researching and writing a paragraph or two to replace the simple allusion to critics pinning (ignorantly usually) the space opera label on work by Simmons.  It is taking more time than I would have hoped  so I am taking a 5 minute break on doing this to tell you I am working on it.  Simmons does not write classic ``hard science`` science fiction like the old masters Asimov, Clarke and Heinlein.  Instead he writes a form of grandiose social SF which is sometimes related to the social SF or Soft science fiction tradition of Bradbury, Le Guin, Vance and others.  I wanted to do fast justice to his continuation, in his own very particular style, of that tradition by making a rapid allusion to the fact that his literary approach is really not space opera.

"`Today I made a change to some of the wording in this section, based on the notion that a ``right`` is inherent/inalienable and is thus not something which can be conferred, rather only acknowledged and protected, at least when talking about law, social contracts and a political candidate's position in regard to such matters. In particular, phrases like ``Kerry wants to grant rights to homosexuals`` (which I removed altogether) I find to be somewhat sub-NPOV. The position of the GLBT community is not unlike that of women and minorities in previous eras: that they have rights that are not being recognized or equally protected. I suppose a truly neutral phrasing would acknowledge that some people feel that such rights do not exist and thus do not deserve broad legal protections or social recognition. I opted to just remove the most contentious phrase, which was redundant anyway, and to add qualifiers to another phrase to reflect the Jeffersonian POV w.r.t. inalienable rights.  `",0

"Thanks to all for taking my rather offhand comment seriously.  To reiterate my original explanatoin to James: I'm interested in this more on a meta level (how do we approach controversial subjects) than out of deep feelings one way or the other towards Moore and his film; that is, I'm trying to see the forest of making a good article on the film rather than the trees of every factual detail within the film that contributors might have multiple viewpoints about.  For an encyclopedia based around the concept of a Neutral Point of View, any attempt to either counter or defend the content of a subject that is, in itself, an editorial statment seems wrong; such discussions wind up as parasites draining the life and meaning out of an otherwise useful article.  See, for example, something like Roe v. Wade  there's no need to use that article to debate all the pros and cons of the subject involved  there are other articles for that linked at the bottom  just state the facts about the case.  Even if you really consider Moore's movie to be completely indefinsible propaganda (and to risk the Wiki-equivalent of Godwin's Law here), note that the article on Triumph of the Will doesn't feel the need to explain all the reasons why Nazi Germany wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

Fortunately, I am not a religious fanatic. But, I do know that provocative sentences like this fuel hatred and anger in the hearts of those groups you mentioned. Again I may be wrong. You know all ) But, I do feel that there is no 'present day sun' or 'present day moon'. That was the only impetus behind my editing it. Besides I also thought that there is nothing wrong in representing a fact (name 'sagarmatha'). Again you know all.   My assumption very well may be incorrect, but no explanation of your reversion has been given. Convince me. :I confirm that your assumption is not only untrue but is provocative and preposterous. Sometimes even highly intelligent people like you do mistakes )  Note that the original name of Presidency College (in Calcutta, founded in 1817) was ``Hindoo College``. Not ``Hindu`` (as in the religion). Please stop reverting. It seems to me that if you insist on using one of the original names of Mount Everest, for consistency you must also use the original name of the college.

It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due (I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player, but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him) and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one.

Geweihte could also mean ``horned``, which would make sense in the case of demons. ``Sanctified``, as in ``blessed``, makes less sense in the context.    Another tricky one: Wayang-Klitik-Figuren meist erheblich beschädigt, sehr zum Gaudium der Zuschauer...`` I haven't even ventured a translation for this, it has several words I don't properly know. Is Gaudium perhaps the Latin word, as in ``gaudeamus igitur``?     This has now been satisfactorily rendered.     Another problematic sentence: Aus diesem Grunde haben Wayang-Klitik-Figuren, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden und dort Kampfszenen zu durchstehen haben, Arme aus Leder. I currently have this partially translated as ``On this basis the wayang klitik figures have, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden and where battle scenes zu durchstehen haben, leather arms.`` I know that durchstehen is to stand one's ground, but I still can't fully translate the sentence.     This has now been satisfactorily rendered.     And another: Aus Jenggala und Kediri stammen die Geschichten von Raden Panji und Cindelaras, die ein paar Dorfjungen mit ihren Kampfhähnen erleben. The first part is ``From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelara,`` I'm not at all clear on the latter part. My dictionary says Kampfhähnen are literally fighting cocks, but can just be pugnacious people.    * Someone else has now simply rendered this as fighting cocks, but I'd consider that suspect (since one can't tell from the original German). I'd like to find a more primary source before considering this necessarily correct.    : I translated it as I did, because it explicitly says ``the boys with their X``, and not somthing like ``the two x-like boys``.    An interesting link:  :Wooden puppet is performed almost the same way as the wayang kulit, but there is no screen in front of the puppeteer, and no banana trunk to stuck the wayang. In stead a 'Plangkan' (permanent wooden table with holes) to support the wooden puppets is used.''    :: Hmm. Looks like we could have a copyvio on our hands.

"`  == More discussion of changes ==  Here's a few excerpts from the article that I'd like to visit:  1. ``Smith's earliest religious experiences, which involved heavenly visions and visitations, the use of seer stones to obtain obscure knowledge and to locate buried treasure, were not uncommon where Smith lived, and the fashionably elite Protestant clergy of the area were not impressed by Smith's early visions and divinations, but neither were they likely surprised or alarmed``  There are a couple problems with the above.  First, whether seer stones were used by others to obtain obscure knowledge particularly ``where Smith lived.``  (I'll explain why I think that's important later.)  Second, whether Joseph used ``the`` seer stones (Urim and Thummim) to locate buried treasure, and whether such efforts were religious experiences (to him they were not).  (To my knowledge his treasure hunting efforts were limited to the time prior to obtaining the Urim and Thummim.)  Third, whether the ``fashionably elite Protestant clergy`` (whatever that means, which probably needs changing) were not impressed by the early visions and divinations (and subsequently not surprised or alarmed).  This claim should either a) be removed for its lack of verifiability, or b) be augmented by the remarks that Joseph himself makes as a first-hand witness.  I honestly don't have a recommended alternative.  The entire paragraph is fairly ripe for discussion in my opinion.  Just to recap:  :a. Whether the use of seer stones was restricted to Joseph's residential area. :b. Whether treasure hunting was a religious experience for him. :c. i. Whether the term ``fashionably elite`` is remotely relevant to the article. :c. ii. Joseph's own recount of clergy response should be included at the very least.   2. ``the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. was raised`` is facially inaccurate.  Joseph spent the first ten years of his life in Vermont, with only four years in New York prior to the First Vision. I suggest the following rewording of the second half of the entire sentence:  ``that campaign also took place in the Burned-over district of western New York where Joseph Smith, Jr. had lived for four years.``   3. ``Nevertheless, Mormon extrapolations regarding Jesus are in many ways more similar to the earliest Christian heresies.``  A rather strong claim , and I don't mind keeping it in, but it should be on the following conditions: 1. ``earliest`` be quantified to a given year, and ``Christian`` quanitified to a sect of the time. 2. We add the following text from Hugh Nibley's ``The World and the Prophets,`` which tells of a time when current generally-accepted Christian beliefs were heresies: :``Ignatius of Antioch writes to the Trallians: 'There are some Christ-betrayers... They introduce God as being unknown.' And to the Smyrnaens he says: 'Do ye, therefore, mark those who preach other doctrines, how they affirm that the Father of Christ cannot be known.`` (page 55) :``The great crime of the heretics in general, according to the Apostolic Constitutions, is 'that they blaspheme God by saying that he is unknowable and not the Father of Christ...but is indescribable, unutterable, unnamable, self-begotten...'`` (page 55)   4. ``Mormon followers of Brigham Young generally believe in Young's doctrine that Jesus was ``born`` into a ``spirit body``, like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his Incarnation.``  The word incarnation doesn't fit the context of the sentence, and I'd prefer to discuss Mormonism here.  I recommend we change that to say:  ``The branch of Mormonism lead by Brigham Young teaches that Jesus was ``born`` into a ``spirit body,`` like the rest of humanity, and remained in that state until his mortal birth.``   5. ``He claimed to have received revelation only after asking questions about a subject, pondering, and praying to God for an answer. As Smith's teachings evolved, his later teachings painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son with physical celestial bodies, being one in purpose together with the Holy Spirit.``  I think the first sentence is out of place (read it in context to see my meaning).  I'd like to clarify the second sentence; it could be understood that Smith's teaching's regarding the Godhead changed rather than expanded.  I'd like to reword as follows:  ``As Smith's teachings about God expanded they gradually painted a strikingly different picture of the Father and the Son than that of other churches, with each possessing a physical, purified body, being one in purpose with the Holy Ghost.``  (As a side note, the phrase ``especially in the region of the country where Mormo",0

But 'power' that's a word that can't be used in this sense without FURTHER definition,because it's too ambiguous outside of a context that specifically implies what meaning is meant.                                    ::::I think if we have the word 'exclusive' (the key point) in the opening paragraph, the rest can be saved for the later paragraph, where it is now... sparing people who just want the overview from reading mumbojumbo, but retaining the info for those who want a more thorough exposition.  ::If a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.  ::::I think this is a splendid summation of the concept of defacto sovereignty  I think if we  keep the defacto vs dejure info in the 'differing views' section, it ties together the 3 seemingly different views by the common thread of, ``no matter what your view is on sovereignty , you have to have it to use it and use it to have it``  and if we add your summary it makes the 'differing views' section just about right.   A key element of sovereignty in the legalistic sense is that of exclusivity of jurisdiction.   Specifically, when a decision is made by a sovereign entity, it cannot generally be ovverruled by a higher authority.  Further, it is generally held that another legal element of sovereignty requires not only the legal right to exercise power, but the actual exercise of such power.  (``no de jure sovereignty without de facto sovereignty``) In other words, neither claiming/being proclaimed Sovereign, nor merely exercising the power of a Sovereign is sufficient, sovereignty requires both elements.   If a sovereign state can make a decision but cannot carry it out, the recognized sovereignty of the state is essentially meaningless.  ::::But if I may? I think this is one tiny bit better, as it applies to the anarchists, monarchs,etc: If a sovereign - person or state - can make a decision but cannot carry it out, their recognized sovereignty is essentially meaningless.

"` ==Nash equilibria== The game theory section is quite confused, which is amusing given how straightforward the analysis claims to be.  The article can't decide whether it's talking about a single-round Nash equilibrium, or the Nash equilibrium of a repeated game.  It talks about repetition, and a threatened ``retaliation`` the Predictor, but it describes an equilibrium which doesn't need retaliation or a repeated game at all.  The equilibrium {choose both boxes, predict both boxes} is quite stable for the single-round game, and is the only Nash equilibrium.  Both players choosing ``one box`` is also a Nash equilibrium for the repeated game.  However, when we have a repeated game, another Nash equilibrium is possible.  If the Predictor adopts a strategy ``always choose one box unless the Chooser chose two boxes last round`` then the Chooser can also always choose one box and have no incentive to deviate.  Deviating would net an extra 1,000 for that round, but would cap the maximum payoff at 1,000 in the next round, where it would have been 1,000,000.  Hence, the deviation is discouraged and the equilibrium is stable.  The real question is, is any of this germane to the article's topic?  If this section could be made concise and simple, I could see including it.

"`  == ``Exporting revolution`` ==  After a recent edit, the paragraph that begins, ``With the Depression of the 1930's...`` now ends, ``In Soviet Russia, a government arose which imposed collectivism on agriculture and took state command of every aspect of the economy, and promised to 'export revolution'.`` The latter part of this seems quite wrong. Enforced collective farms are indeed a Stalinist program; exporting revolution really isn't. Stalin was (especially at this time) precisely the champion of ``revolution in one country``; exporting revolution was far more the plan of Lenin and Trotsky. I'll leave this for a bit to give the author of the passage a shot at editing to indicate what (if anything) he/she actually meant, but if no one modifies this soon, I probably will.   `",0

"  :::Well, although I do concede that most (if not all) of those Mexican States are named after the cities, I still think that the State should have priority since a) Politically and geographically is more important b) They will be linked way more often than the cities. To illustrate my point, let’s take the State of Oaxaca. We will need a link to the state in every single municipality (Oaxaca has 570!), in every single river that passes by, in every single lake, lagoon, dam, forest, desert, valley, plateau, mountain, cave, indigenous group, highway, bridge, volcano, beach, port, island... Even in biographies: governors, senators, people that fought battles there, colonized…   :::Keep in mind that most of us do not advocate the application of the North American convention to Mexican cities (City, State), so whenever we want to be more specific, we make links like Xyz, Oaxaca not Xyz, Oaxaca (state). By giving priority to the States we could type less and have fewer links to fix in those articles made by visitors, newbies or people not familiar with the country (most wikipedians). If someone says that José Vasconcelos was born in Oaxaca but links to the state instead of the city, s/he is still OK, not as precise as s/he intended to be, but s/he’s still correct. But if someone says that the cave of Guilá Naquitz is in Oaxaca and points to the city instead of the State, s/he is plain wrong.  :::Cheers,  ",0

The fact that another contributor is so determined to remove this evidence from the public record demonstrates that the point Jeremiah makes is sensitive. Nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the Jewish law, and for that reason should remain.  If other contributors wish to argue that Jeremiah's comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to Biblical passages about circumcision, they are welcome to demonstrate this. However, censorship is not the way to make this point.`",0

"`Just for the record, Castro apologised for his treatment of gays . While this doesn't mean that what he did was all fine now, it shows that he is at least remorseful and has stopped persecuting people based on their sexuality. In 1992 he told a Sandinista official:  ``I'm not going to deny that, at a certain point, this machista thing, influenced the approach that was taken toward homosexuality. I personally  you are asking me my personal opinion  do not suffer from this type of phobia against homosexuals. Truly, in my mind, that's never been there and I have never been in favor nor have I promoted [homosexuality], nor have I supported [laws against homosexuality].``  I don't see homosexuality as a phenomenon of degeneration, but rather I see it in another way. The approach has been of another sort: a more rational approach, considering the tendencies and natural things of the human being, who simply must be respected. This is the philosophy with which I view these problems. I think that there has to be consideration shown toward the family that suffers these situations. I would hope that the families would have another mentality, that they would have another approach when something of this sort happens. I am absolutely opposed to any form of repression, disdain, contempt or discrimination with respect to homosexuals. That's what I think.`` '''''']]    `",0

It's clear that we have some very different opinions, but we're making some good headway here.  BUT the ``Controversy`` section is almost entirely attacks from one side(about two dozen sentences), the long list of allegedly significant ``ties``, and numerous (often angry) quotes from Kerry's team and supporters (including many in the media), many of which add little or no actual information or argument for their position.  On the other side we find a few brief Bush-Cheney denials, and maybe two quotes.  Fine, if you're trying to sound like an LA Times editorial.  But I didn't think that's what we were after here.  (And, of course, there is the insistence that certain responses to charges are not relevant, even if these are the actual responses Bush, et.al. are making.   I didn't think it was our job to judge the strength of each side's argument simply to seek to represent it fairly.)

"` :::The net effect is that you deleted a bunch of content, plus which there is more to say about each individual rate (construction particulars for instance), plus it doesn't work with the categorization system. When thinking about merging articles, one important thing to consider is whether the article is small because it's new and needs more content, or it will always be small. In the case of the RN rates, all have much to say about them - rationale, evolution, employment, plus a picture or two so we can see what they looked like. This article should be about the system as a whole (who introduced it and why? When did it go out of use? How did it compare to other nations' systems?) - once you have adequate treatment of all that, plus the two screenfuls with two representative pictures per rate, that's a pretty hefty article, no longer easy for reader to get the basic definition of ``third-rate``. When considering organization like this, it's worthwhile to look at history of all the articles concerned, and maybe query the editors who set it up, because what you've effectively done is to destroy article structure that I and others carefully set up some time ago.

"`Fish-man, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.  Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.  #First, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.) #Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  ``No-boo`` may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition. #If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called ``The No-boo Affair``, then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is ``the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did``, it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a ``clear falsification``, but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term ``no-boo`` becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted. #Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this ``No-boo Affair`` is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.  It is important to understand that an encyclopedia is not simply a gathering of assorted facts, but rather a secondary source that compiles significant pieces of human knowledge that have already been well-established by other sources.  There are many places on the internet and offline where you can disseminate facts and opinions about this event, but Wikipedia is not one of them.  — `",0

Samuel Blount, the candidate's son, who also worked with Bush, said he did not remember such behavior from the future president.

"`  ==66.185.85.80's rant==  Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as ``primitive`` and ``rural`` (even ``fashist``) being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, ``performed`` on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.   Another ``apostle`` of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as ``gusle players``.   Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book ``Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje``, 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry.    Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.    In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound.   Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar.   The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  ``Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West`` that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)  This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)  Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region.   Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre",0

Anglo-Frisian and Old Norse have the most extreme maritime influences, including those Non IE Roots discussed on the Talk:Germanic languages page where you bureaucratically assaulted me also.  As formerly stated(before Diderot POV pushed the article with a massive edit) on the Non IE Roots page(), Celtic is another language group holding a considerable amount of Non IE Roots.  Apart from any Basque influences, Celtic seems to have Non IE terms concentrated mostly in the British Isles, where they were joined by the Anglo-Frisians and Norse.  It is blatantly clear to anybody that the Mediterranean influence on High German is astounding.  The older Nordic and Germanic writings appear less structured and thought out, but the more evolution into current speech, the tongues have been so standardised by latinisation, especially.  One cannot seriously refute that the Anglo-Frisian and West Norse tongues follow the least marked latinising structures on their tongues of the Germanic languages(and especially borrowing scientific terms), apart from writing them in latin script, with a few native letters especially in Icelandic to this day.  The Baltic East Norse tongues gained a considerable conversion by the influence of the Low German speakers of the Hanseatic League in their everyday life, most notable in the Hanseatic Cities, like Visby on Gotland.  Since High German has been standardising itself all throughout Germany, having a marked effect upon such others as Austrian and Swiss German, all the dialects of Germany and even in Eastern Europe are suffering at the officialisation and BBC type overtaking.

Major motion pictures like Ararat which cover the genocide cannot be shown in Turkey, sometimes due to the government, sometimes due to terrorist threats.

"`The Loeb edition bears the inside title (after the 50pp of introductory material) ``Ammiani Marcellini Rerum Gestarum libri qui supersunt``. (The volume titles are merely ``Ammianus Marcellinus``, although they include no other work by him, since none has survived.) This inside title translates as ``The books that survive of the Deeds/Acts/History of Ammian Marcellinus``. Nowhere have I been able to find where this Latin ``title`` comes from; I can't remember reading or hearing anyone actually refer to AM's History as ``Res Gestae``, although that's a Latin phrase that can be translated history.  The ``Divi Augustae`` (sic), on the other hand, is a much clearer mistake; which should have been — so to speak — ``Divi Augusti``, although FWIW (not very much) one can find ``RG Divi Augustae`` online.

His creed can certainly be said to be destruction of the current culture and certainly retrograde in many respects, seeking to return to a simpler subsistence level of existence (i.e. hunter/gatherer) but he definitely has an established ethos and world-view.

Apperantely they own the copyright somehow. Either way, the narrator in the book does use Joe rather than Jack. And given that the book is the original story, I believe that ``Joe`` should be used more often in the article than ``Jack`` (though ``the narrator`` fits the character's ``name`` more accurately). The article seems to lean too much towards being about the movie, which makes it seem as if it was the original source material instead of the book.

See:  The '''Great Purge''' is the name given to the events of the late [[1930s]] in the [[Soviet Union]], when millions of people were arrested, about one million executed, and an estimated 12 million to sent to labour camps.  According to [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|Nikita Khrushchev]] a significant part of the accusations were based on forced [[confession]]s and on loose interpretations of vague articles of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)]], which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal deliberation was largely replaced with express trials by [[NKVD troika]]s.  The purge targeted all categories of the society: members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], the government, the armed forces and the intelligentsia, as well as ``anti-Soviet elements`` among peasants ([[kulak]]s), in industry, and in transport. The height of the purge occurred while the Soviet secret police (the [[NKVD]]) was headed by [[Nikolai Yezhov]], from September [[1936]] to August [[1938]]; this period is often referred to as the '''Yezhovschina''' (``Yezhov storm``). However, the purge was carried out on the orders of Stalin himself.  It is rather obvious that you do not have a copy of this standard reference work available or choose not to refer to it.

"`  ::And what do ``quanta`` and ``cosmology`` have in common?  Energy.  To simply categorize physics as ``the study of everything`` is imperceptive.  When modeling sand falling into a pile (or nuts sorting in a jar) a physicist doesn't really care about the identity of the particles at hand, just certain ``bulk`` properties that relate to its energetics.  The chemist tries to understand how the material composition in turn generates those energetic qualities, but then usually isn't capable of formulating the dynamic description of what happens when it's shaken (or spilled).  A physicst usually could care less about why niobium is better for a collider than copper, just that it is.  And chemists don't just care about chemical elements and compounds, there is a whole field of chemistry dedicated to monitoring interactions of nuclei with nucleons (nuclear chemistry)  still matter.  As a point of culture, chemists tend to focus on the diversity of matter and how that affects interactions with energy and physicists focus on the unity of energy, and how that affects matter.  Physical chemists very nicely bridge this  they put quite a bit of energetics while still caring deeply about the identity of that which is being studied.

They are simply repeating a claim that he has made, which has nothing to do with proving what Bao Dai said or did, or whether there is a Nguyen coat of arms.

"  == Parentacide ==  Parentacide is the term used to describe a child killing one or both parents. Although the subject is as abhorrent as suicide or infantecide, it is a part of our life that cannot be dismissed.  Parentacide dates back to Greek mythology, where Oedipus killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Frued coined the term Oedipus complex to describe a state of psychosexual development and awareness first occuring at the age of 3 1/2 years.  In 1989 Lyle and Erik Menendez commited parentacide when they murdered both of their parents in cold blood. Although the murders were at least partially motivated by money, the brothers alleged their father had abused them, which was their justification for the killing.  Jeremy Bamber committed parentacide by proxy and was convicted in 1986 of killing his adoptive parents, sister, and her two six year old sons. Although money was thought to be the motive for this killing spree, the fact that he was adopted indicates that the reasons behind the murders were less clear cut. Being adopted, Bamber very likely suffered from adopted child syndrome, which is a psychological maladjustment to the knowledge that his real parents had given him up for adoption.",0

With any luck, a developer will see the request before too long. Once the domain is on the filter, a page containing the domain cannot be saved (annoyingly, there are ways to get around this, but it usually takes care of the problem).  Anyway, nice work on the rewrite. I hope you like it here and choose to stick around! Cheers,     == On War ==  neat job -) |   == Zone system ==  I would appreciate your leaving the mention in. First Ansel Adams, in his three volume 1980 basic photography series, presented the Zone system this way and he explicitly said, in so many words, that his aim is not to force his own system of photography on anyone, but to encourage photographers to better understand their equipment in order to control the finished photograph. He disapproved of winging it, not of any particular system. The Zone system worked for him. And the Zone system is controversial, believe it or not. I know of at least one vocational school photography teacher (years ago when I lived in Montreal) who told students not to bother with it, and it seems he was not alone.   Also, please wait a few days before doing a major edit job. I liked the article as it used to be and I was sorely tempted to revert most of your changes, but did not. I particularly liked the wording ``dynamic range`` and miss it, and I'm sorry to say I now personally find the article less approachable to a newcomer.   Dynamic range is very appropriate: for instance (I'm making numbers up here for the sake of argument) if we say reality has a Zone 0 to X range of 1 to 100,000 , then a finished print has a range of 1 to 10,000 , while a typical digital camera will only provide a range of 1 to 1,000 . A move from 100,000 to 10,000 to 1,000 seems pretty dynamic to me...  However, since I'm not going to reread the whole Basic Photography series or even go into a darkroom again (space is at a premium in Tokyo) I'm not willing to put too much effort into maintaining this page.    :Hi Vincent: :Which idea, specifically, did you wish to restore to the zone system article? That the zone system is/was not advocated by all? (I'd say that's probably true for most any school of thought.) That Ansel Adams was not dogmatic about this being the only way to do things? (I'd say that unless there is a large public misimpression that he was dogmatic it's not worth mentioning, no more than it's necessary to mention that every painter or sculptor or engineer held other approaches to various disciplines were equally valid.)  :Here's the problem with ``dynamic range,`` Vincent: it's inaccurate jargon.

"  ::Thank you for your kind reply. Judging from the sources I have, I think the concept of spatial tense is only relevant in the context of the artificial language Lojban. The statement that several natural languages have spatial tense as defined in the article is still an unsubstantiated claim, so imho it should be pulled out pending evidence. Part of the problem is the very name of the concept. 'Tense' has the connotation of 'time'. In fact, grammatical tense is frequently (if loosely) defined as 'location in time'. Thus, it doesn't really make sense to talk about 'spatial tense'; it would be like talking about 'temporal place'. ::Since the only relevant use of the concept stems from Lojban grammar, I think it would be best to start the article out of the Lojban perspective, defining spatial tense as Lojban grammar defines it. And since spatial tense (according to Lojban grammar) is merely 'obligated expression of location', the broader context of the article should be the expression of space in language. And this is where observations about the connection between language and the way we perceive the world come in. The way I see it, the spatial cases of the Hopi language (one of the many languages that do very interesting things with space) don't really belong in an article about an invented, English-inspired, grammatical category. What we are really missing is a decent article about the way languages deal with location and space. Which is something I added to my to do list. —   ",0

"`  :* that's exactly it, i think.  it's a paradigm difference.  some people see creationism as morally and factually wrong because of their PARADIGM, and others see it as morally and factually right because of THEIR paradigm.  and they're throwing falsifiability and bias and everything else at each other ... but when it comes down to it, it's a PARADIGM difference.  At the same time, however, one, the other, or something else IS factually true.  And so what SCIENCE needs to do is keep as BROAD a paradigm as possible in allowing itself to go through the process of falsification.  A scientific community that ASSUMES Genesis is true will be limited in its ability to falsify itself ... because it will always say, ``well ... we just haven't figuredn out how to justify that assumption yet  but we will!``  Similarly, a scientific community that ASSUMES God does not exist will say the same thing.  I think what science needs to do is take a position of NEUTRALITY regarding the hypotheses of a creator  and allow falsification to take its course.  :* where this leads me is this.  the falsifiable assertions of evolution are: ``Evolution is false where there are clear and distinct boundaries between ``kinds,`` across which macroevolution cannot occur`` and ``evolution is false where life, by its very nature, can never arise from non-life.``  In my opinion, IF the theory is falsified in that way, ID becomes the ``improved theory``  because it takes ALL the contemporary evidence that is explained by evolution, AND explains abiogenesis and macroevolution  making it that new path integral formulation to F=ma.  However, ID requires the PARADIGM shift that there IS a creator.  :: not trying to convince you ... just trying to articulate the ID POV for page development  do you have a corresponding evo pov or a critique of this one?   `",0

"`    I'd like to clarify my concerns with the current version of the article, following the reversion of some of my edits by Stirling Newberry.  My general concern is that it doesn't accurately describe the debate about various causes of hyperinflation.  The article seems to me to be describing a stereotyped view of each side of the debate, which exagerrates the amount of controversy and obscures the amount of common ground.  ``Monetary`` and ``Crisis of confidence`` explanations of hyperinflation are describes as if they are two completely different competing theories,  held by different schools of thought (``monetarists`` and ``neo-liberals``).  I think that the overwhelming majority of economists would see both monetary and confidence factors as being important as the initial 'root cause' of hyperinflation, with the importance varying from case to case.  A lot of the economics is very uncontroversial. For example: *It's totally uncontroversial that a massive increase in the money supply will cause hyperinflation.  Virtually any economist will agree that a big increase in the money supply is a possible trigger for hyperinflation, even if they don't believe it's the only one.  To say imply that neo-liberal economists don't believe that some hyperinflations are initially triggered by monetary expansion is to caricature their position. *It's totally uncontroversial that loss of confidence in the monetary system has a big role in hyperinflation.  To imply that monetarists don't see a role for reestablishing confidence in the currency - that just 'stopping the printing presses' is enough - is just misleading.  Monetarists talk about ways of establishing confidence all the time.  I would be interested to hear from Stirling what specific inaccuracies were in my edits, and why he deleted the statement ``The two models are closely related, and often economists may explain hyperinflation as being due to a combination of both effects.``   `",0

"`  :The evidence from British Isles and IONA is that the term ``British Isles`` was used as a geographical term for the isles including Ireland in the 17th century, but in the 20th century became politically unacceptable to Irish nationalists. Thus ``British Civil Wars`` is geographically accurate, but in addition to treading on current sensibilities it has the misleading suggestion of a British state at the time and civil wars could be held to exclude the Bishops Wars, so the Wars of the Three Kingdoms is much preferred. The ``English Civil War`` title is well established in English histories, but is obviously a daft term for Montrose, for example, when all his fights were in Scotland.

Sharon went on to drive the PLO out of Lebanon and to try to install a more friendly regime there. ... The Israelis stayed, and their effort to install a new regime ended in disaster.``   * The Invasion was planned :``When, in early June 1982, terrorists of the Abu Nidal organization, a PLO splinter group, badly wounded the Israeli ambassador in London during an assassination attempt, Israel seized the pretext for launching its long-planned offensive.``   * The Invasion was opposed by the US and the UN: :* See ``U.N. Security Council Resolution 509`` :*``On June 6, President Reagan, in France to meet with the G-7 Heads of Government at the Versailles Economic Summit, dispatched Habib to Israel to try to restore the cease-fire. That same day the United States joined a unanimous U.N. Security Council Resolution demanding that Israel withdraw from Lebanon and that the border cease-fire be observed by all parties.``   * Other details: :``September 15, 1982: Ariel Sharon arrives in Beirut to personally direct the IDF campaign ...

However, many women, and entire families as well, ran away from the camps to the north. I went back and repeated my report over and over. Each time, however, the answer was the same: ``It is okay.``...It was possible to stop the massacre in Shatila, even on Thursday; had they acted on what we reported to our commander.

That is what the WikiZionists intend to do. They want to rename this article to something ``neutral`` (i.e. something that doesn't reflect the facts about Israeli atrocities against Palestinian children) and then pad it with sensationalized Zionist POV sections about Palestinian resistance to Zionist aggression. They already have plenty of Zionist POV articles smearing all palestinians as fanatic terrorists rather than victims of Zionist terrorism.

There are quotes from Zionist rabbis on this page that are indistinguishable from the logic of Hamas clerics. The denial of Zionism's genocidal intent and practice is similar to Nazis who denied the Holocaust and Final Solution even as they conducted it.

I like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the passage of the so-called ``Race laws`` of the 30s that led to the Holocaust of the 40s - there was a cause and effect.  :::Now with that preface out of the way I am stating that the 1215 Magna Carta contains the smoking gun of England's own move to rid the Isles of the Jews. This is not hidden history but well documented history. It is just not talked about because the English (I am English) don't want to be thought of as being antisemitic, but English history reeks of antisemitism.  :::What is not being addressed here (and even less now that someone has added the censor's touch), is that the Pope of Rome (there were other Popes), controlled England through his king; church and law (there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the Church and the Church was the one Church based in Rome. I hope everyone knows about Henry VIII so that I don't have to explain that as well.)  :::So the Jews were moneychangers. Why were they moneychangers? Go and do your own research! You need to know. The Jews had a moneychanger relationship with the Church and that is why the clause is in there: the Jews were (are) not Christians (duh!) - not members of the Church of Rome. The Pope gave them special status. The representative for all of the wheeler-dealing was the Archbishop. The barons were merely local gangsters, or in today's understanding = warlords (thugs.)  :::The statements about the Jews in Magna Carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the Jews were - everyone knew who the Jews were. They were the People of the blood libel (``they killed Jesus``). The Church whose Jesus the Jews killed put up with them like the Nazis used Jews when it suited them and some Jews (a few) went along with the Nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of Jews. This is the thorny issue we are dealing with. Under English law the Jews were forbidden to do practically anything else but be moneychangers! They were the scum of society and the Church had a need for a sub-class of human beings. The Jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the Jews were murdered and abused. Because of the holier than thou attitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today, the English do not want to admit that they were at it long before Herr Hitler got into the business!  :::Now move along to 1297 and ``bingo!`` = no Jews. Why? Because they were kicked out of England, forced to go underground or convert. Same thing happened in Spain. (Hello, isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany?) It was not until the time of Cromwell - long after Henry VIII told the Pope bye, bye and long after Shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending Jew that Cromwell talked about religious tolleration. Why? Because Cromwell ruled the English Republic which had severed its relationship with the Church by chopping off the head of the king; abolishing the House of Lords and raiding all of the Church properties to put them out of business. Then the forces of the Republic went to Ireland and engaged in ``ethnic cleansing`` by wholesale murder and mayhem.  :::Read your history. Move up to the time of 18th Century and read about the status of Jews in Parliament (how and when they were finally allowed to sit in Parliament.)  :::The bottom line. The Magna Carta of 1215 needs to be explained: who wrote it and why and what it says and why. What we have here on Wiki right now is pure boring propaganda that explains nothing. But by looking at the clauses dealing with the Jews you can see that while the English may get on their high horses and yell about the evil Germans (remember the UK Royals are German are hiding under another name since WWI), then it is possible to gulp and say ``me too`` (in English) and understand that evil knows no race or religion.  `",0

"`    ==death to critics==  So instead of  'every' earlier, now you are giving isolated cases, such as Theo van Gogh, Vincent van Gogh, Rashad Khalifa, and Irshad Manji who received death threats or were killed by anonymous unknown radicals.  What happened to every claim? Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals! You need to post the names of prominent Islamic scholars and universities such as Al Azhar (not isolated radicals) who issued the death sentence against these people. The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries except Iran. So all you need to do is post Islamic sites (not anti-Islamic sites and isolated radical sites) who issued the death sentence against Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc. Bring your proof. Just throwing the names of isolated cases where someone received death threats from isolated anonymous radical doesn't prove Islam sanctions death sentence to it's critics! After 9/11, many Muslims and mosques received threats and some Muslims/Sikhs were even killed. That doesn't mean the US sanctions death to all American Muslims.  You are such a pathetic joke, dude!  Posting isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals doesn't prove a thing. We don't even know for sure who killed Rashad. You added even his name. You need to post the names of Muslim scholars who issues death sentence against, say, Rashad, Vincent van Gogg, and Menji. Then you need to post evidence that this was consensus among Muslim scholars on each of these cases.  Without that, you don't have any case, and you are refuted once again    : ``Anyway, to prove your case that Islam sanctions death sentence to its critics, you can't just post the names of isolated cases where people received death threats from anonymous radicals!

The fatwa  against Rushdie was rejected by Al Azhar and all countries`` <- these anonymous radicals represent the sentiments felt by their factions in ISlam -they represent their interpretation of Islam. I also provided examples of critics who were murdered by MUHAMMAD himself. Al-Azhar is not a higher authority than Muhammad.  ::No, you have only provided two stories in Ibn Ishaq about Muhammad that are rejected by Muslims, such as rejected here.  Al Azhar and Muslim scholars will interpret what Muhammad did and what Islamic law says, not an anti-Islamic bigot like you. You made a bold claim that in Islam critics are to be to be killed. I refuted that by giving examples that contradict that. You then claimed that every critic received a death sentence. You were refuted again. You then posted a list of isolated critics such as Rushdie, Menji, Rashad Khalifa, Theo van Gogh, etc, who received death threats from anonymous radicals. That's like posting (a much longer list) of Muslims/Sikhs who received death threats or were killed after 9/11, and claiming that American law allows Muslims to be killed. You were refuted again.  You need to provide names of prominent well known Muslim scholars (not anti-Islam sites or isolated radicals) for each of these cases and prove that they issued the death sentence. After that, you need to provide proof that that judgement was a consensus among Muslims scholars. You didn't do that. You were refuted once again. Since you are an anti-Islamic bigot, you can't just claim that Muhammad did this or that or Islamic law says this or that and expect that claim to be inserted in Encyclopedia. You need to provide proof. You couldn't because you were wrong. Try again, dude. You have failed quite miserably here    :Furthermore, whe opinons of secular governments are irrelevant - of course Musilm countries rejected the death fatwa against Rushdie, but this was due to international politics, not due to religion. Also, as stated before, Ayatollah Khomenie was a Shiah CLERIC. The only way to be an Ayatollah is to be born as one. Aside from being the dictator or IRan, Khomenie was also the spiritial and religious leader of huge numbers of Sha'ias around the world. Khomenie wrote many fatwas and books about Islam. His most famous fatwa, of course, calls for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Now Al-Azhar - a SUNNI university  SUPPOSEDLY rejected KHomenei's teachings.

"`  == OneGuy's vanadalism of the discussion page == Aside from OneGuy deleting other user's comments, he has now begun to blatently disorganize and effectively vanadalize people's comments: he distrupting the flow of users' comments by arbitrarily cutting off paragraphs and inserting his comments in between, instead of being civil and adding his reply to the end of a given post. Combined with his ceasless personal attacks, false accusations, and insistance on making wikipedia a propoganda machine for Islamist apologetics of the blackest kind, his behaviour has become completely intolerable, and I do not see any point in constantly refuting the same false accusations and false assertions over and over again.

OneGuy, in his complaint in arbitration, accused me of rivert(sic) wars and having POV in my contributions yet he does the exact same thing, only more so.  In the arbitration complaint, the arbitrators don't seem as concerned about the POV contributions as they do about personal attacks, revert wars and my vandalism of his user page. See Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/168.209.97.34.  When OneGuy was giving evidence against me he incorrectly called a few minor word changes as a revert war (even though the change were only made once or twice) and he clearly left out the revert wars in which he was involved (but the arbitrators were not fooled - they found him out).  ::Since the arbitrators will probably not do anything about his radical apologistic contributions, they will most likely respond to his vandalism of the talk pages.

He implied that interpretation in the article. At worst, the verse condemns the behavior of taking prisoners in order to make money, but he has not given his source that says 8:67 means kill prisoners.

"`   :: First victim of what? Biri's death is not part of the al-Aqsa Intifada because the intifada started after his death - after Ariel Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. You see, that's how it got the name ``al-Aqsa``. The Israeli government propaganda repeated at the websites you list claims that the Palestinians started the al-Aqsa intifada before Sharon even visited the al-Aqsa site. Even the ``Palestine Facts`` source you cite and the objective Mitchell report point to Sharon's visit as the trigger for the al-Aqsa intifada. Of course there is constant violence in the area so anyone can name his own start date. We can go back to 1948 or 1917 if you want. It does no service to Wikipedia to throw Israeli government propaganda into the article. ( I am sure that won't stop you though).     ::*``Also on September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. This visit became the pretext for instigating large scale demonstrations, the start of the al-Aqsa infifada.``    ::*``On September 28, 2000, Ariel Sharon marched defiantly and provocatively through the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, touching off the current round of violence. ``     ::The Mitchell Report: ::*``Mr. Sharon made the visit on September 28 accompanied by over 1,000 Israeli police officers. Although Israelis viewed the visit in an internal political context, Palestinians saw it as highly provocative to them. On the following day, in the same place, a large number of unarmed Palestinian demonstrators and a large Israeli police contingent confronted each other. According to the U.S. Department of State, ``Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.``[4] According to the GOI, 14 Israeli policemen were injured.[5] Similar demonstrations took place over the following several days.[6] Thus began what has become known as the ``Al-Aqsa Intifada`` (Al-Aqsa being a mosque at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount). ``    ::Furthermore, in the article Terrorism_against_Israel_in_2000#August, it says Biri died in August after being attacked by ``terrorists``. (If Biri was an Israeli soldier in occupied Gaza, why are his attackers called ``terrorists`` in Wikipedia?). You need to sort out your Israeli propaganda to at least get the dates and descriptors right.  ::``* August 27: Terrorists attack a group of vehicles traveling to Netzarim with two roadside bombs and automatic gunfire.  David Biri, age 19, is wounded. ::* August 28: David Biri dies of wounds suffered in a Palestinian terrorist attack the previous day. ::* September 29: Border policeman Chief Inspector Yossi Tabaji, 27, of Ramle, killed and a second Israeli border policeman wounded by a Palestinian Authority policeman on a joint patrol near Kalkiliya District Coordinating Office. `` ::Yossi Tabaji and several unnamed Palestinian youth were also killed in the days before the ``official start`` of the al-Aqsa intifada because there are constant killings almost every day in the conflict. The al-Aqsa intifada is an upsurge in the violence that started after Sharon's visit to the al-Aqsa site. That is the commonly understood definition of al-Aqsa intifada. Adding stories about Israeli deaths that happened the day before is just Israeli government propaganda to deflect blame away from Ariel Sharon.  `",0

When the Muslims attempt to enter al-Aqsa for prayers they were barred and later Israeli forces opened fire at the civilian demonstrators, including children, killing 6 and wounding 220.

A secondary, but equally important, goal is to get those users to release ALL of their edits for ALL articles.  I've personally chosen to multi-license all of the  and  contributions under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike License so that other projects, such as WikiTravel, can use our articles.  I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all your contributions (or at minimum those on the geographic articles) so that we can keep most of the articles available under the multi-license.  Many users use the {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} template (or even {{MultiLicensePD}} for public domain) on their user page, but there are other templates for other options at Template messages/User namespace.  If you only prefer using the GFDL, I understand, but I thought I'd at least ask, just in case, since the number of your edits is in the top 100.  If you do want to do it, simply just copy and paste one of the above two templates into your user page and it will allow us to track those users who have done it. For example:  :Option 1 :I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions, with the exception of my user pages, as described below: :{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} OR :Option 2 :I agree to [[Wikipedia:Multi-licensing|multi-license]] all my contributions to any [[U.S. state]], county, or city article as described below: :{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}  Or if you wanted to place your work into the public domain (which many people do or don't like to do, see Wikipedia:Multi-licensing), you could replace {{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}} with {{MultiLicensePD}}   `",0

She took a leave of absence to participate in resistance against the IDF as a member of the Palestinian-led International Solidarity Movement (ISM). In her home town, she was known in the local peace movement and an active member of the Olympia Movement for Justice and Peace.

"The reason I mentioned it was that it seems to me that the most important aspect of the history of atheism in the West is that over the course of about three centuries, it developed from being an accusation, to which nobody would admit, to being the belief system of a major part of the world's population.  But you cannot mention this without also pointing out that this was in large because Communist parties made it the established view in the states they governed.   The association is a historical one, not a logical one, and it is true that there are critics of atheism who try to discredit atheism as a philosophy because of its historical association with Communism (a point mentioned in the article), but the NPOV response to this is NOT just to neglect to mention this important historical association.

"` 2005 (UTC)  :I am perfectly glad, and have been all along, to see this section totally removed from this article. When we spun out the fuller version of this, I wanted to delete this shortened version from here. However, if it stays, I remain concerned what it says, and you and I obviously disagree about that.  : As for your ``obviously``: Once again, you seem to be reading sentences out of context. Look at the context of this passage (italics added for emphasis):  ::``There was division within the left as to the invasion of Afghanistan.  Nonetheless, an international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT Act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights.``  ::``Most prominent in this loose coalition were...``  :This is specifically about the protest movement at the time of the Afghanistan invasion (and was more exclusively so in earlier versions, because someone has now inserted ``and Iraq`` in the next sentence). You say there was no anti-Afganistan-invasion-movement worth mentioning. Don't know where you were. I was in London at the time. 50,000 of us were in Trafalgar Square, that's usually considered a large enough protest to be worth mentioning. I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   |  07:16, Jan 4,`",0

"`   ==Alternative Judaism== Zain, I think that Alternative Judaism is a good place to put the disclaimer about other religious groups that claim they are Jews, but I do think it is worth looking at the links a bit further, since I think you might have misread some of them. Also, remember that there is a difference between claiming descent from the ``Israelites`` and actually claiming to be practicing Judaism.  Here are the links you keep using to illustrate your points, and that you added to the article:  * Anglo-Israelism  Never claimed to be Jews, they claim that the English are the descendents of the lost tribes of Israelites.  Nowhere on their site do they claim to be Jewish or practicing Judaism. I do not think there is a good argument that these people are Jews in any way.  They can and are identified in the Ten Lost Tribes article. * Christian Identity  Weird choice.  They hate Jews, look at the text of the article, where they explicitly condemn Judaism as evil. Certainly not an alternative form of Judaism, nor are they Jews. * Talmidaism  A subset of Christianity, or possibly Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article. * Nazarene A subset of Messianic Judaism, which is already in the article * Messianic Judaism  Already in the article that you edited * Judaizing teachers  Refers to a movement of early Christians, not a current group.  This is like including Jews Harp in the list - it is a reference to a historical label, not a religion. * Jews for Jesus  Already in the article that you edited * Messianic Renewed Judaism  A minor subset of Messianic Judaism * Lost Ten Tribes  Not a religion, but another good place to put these sort of links * British-Israel-World Federation  See Anglo-Israelism  I am open to discussion on these, but do read through the article first.  Do you agree or disagree with these points? It would be good to get this resolved.  `",0

"`  :I asked about sources out of curiosity, not to undermine what you said.  In a Jamaican context what you say is true - from what I cited (and some other reading) I would say that ``Taino`` is preferable to Arawak for the Greater Antilles because it is more specific in that context.  Taino is used specifically for the Arawakan people of the northern Caribbean - so it is a subset of the Arawakan people (and thus not interchangeable).  Taino could be considered a single ``tribe`` within the Arawakan language family.  The Island Caribs were another, as were the Lokono of the mainland.  The Arawakan language family is one of the largest in South America - Brazil, Peru, Bolivia and throughout the Caribbean.  The term Taino is not, to my knowledge, used for groups outside of the northern Caribbean. :The Arawakan people of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico had the most sophisticated cultures, the most powerful chiefdoms.  As far as I can tell, it is to these groups (the ``classic Taino``) plus their related neighbours (the ``eastern Taino`` and the ``western Taino``) that they name Taino applied.  The point is not the word as such, since it was probably not a word that they used for themselves except to proclaim themselves ``friendlies`` to the Spanish.  There was a distinct culture of the northern Caribbean...before I looked it up I though the Lucayans of the Bahamas were not part of that group, but I was wrong.  Words only work if they can be fit to real meaningful concepts. :The term ``Igneri`` has been used for the ``Island Arawaks`` who preceded the Island Caribs in the Lesser Antilles.  This group probably made up the basic substratum of the Island Carib population, and gave rise to the ``Kalinago`` (or women's language) of the Island Caribs.  The men spoke either a Carib language or a Carib-based pidgin, but apparently it had a lot of Arawak words. :The ``traditional`` view of the Island Caribs as interlopers has been severely questioned in recent times.  One source separated out three theories of their origin.  The traditional one (and the one I got in school, etc.) was the ``Carib replacement`` model - that the Caribs invaded and displaced the original Arawak population of the Lesser Antilles, and were spreading northward at the time of Spanish contact.  Another one is the ``Arawak continuity`` model which says that the Arawaks of the Lesser Antilles acquired a Carib pidgin through trading with the Mainland Caribs.  The third is a reticulate model in which Mainland Caribs moved into the Lesser Antilles and merged with the Arawak population in a model comparable to the Norman conquest of England.  I got the impression that modern scholars leaned that way.  One source cited seventeenth century documents that refer to two groups of ``Caribs`` in Grenada, the Galini (probably Kaliña/Karinya, or Mainland Caribs) and the Caraïbes (Island Caribs).  In addition, contemporary sources refer to the Taino of the Greater Antilles fleeing Spanish massacres and joining the Island Caribs.  In the Spanish period the Island Caribs changed from being enemies of the Puerto Rican Tainos to being their allies against the Spanish.  (Main source: Raiders and Traders: Caraïbe Social and Political Networks at the Time of European Contact and Colonization in the Eastern Caribbean - Ann Cody Holdren, 1998, Ph.D. dissertation, UCLA; McGinnis's dissertation - cited above - has a lot of quotes from Columbus's journals and from other contemporary sources). :Arawak (or aruaca), as I mentioned, comes from aru which was the Lokono word for cassava flour.   :I am not a historian, just trying to do my best to see what the primary literature says.  The use of the word Taino is standard for the Greater Antilles, but whether it is ``accurate`` is another matter altogether.  McGinnis points out that Columbus was very selective in how he interpreted data - if you were hostile, then human limbs were proof you were Carib, but if you were friendly, then the heads he found in the village was funerary.  Of course the whole idea of the origin of the Caribs is controvertial.  But the traditional view is by no means accepted without question.  That's what makes history so exciting these days.   `",0

"  I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.  But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.  Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.  For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.  One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.  So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).  So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.  I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others.   I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.  This was dismissed.  Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.  That too was dismissed.  So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.  Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)  In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.  So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.  Two choices.  Stop posting completely  Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.  Hence the challenge.  I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.  I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.  You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.  I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.  So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.  So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.  Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers.

"  My family has fought in every war the USA has been in including the revolution.

My siblings are educated and not prone to believing propaganda and they both feel that we did the right thing when it comes to Iraq, regardless of the presence of WMD. This world is becoming smaller everyday...how much room is there for governments that pose a threat to their neighbors? Beyond any shadow of doubt in my mind, the USA and it's allies and the entire world were incredibly patient with Saddam Hussein, but the time had come to do something and I do not believe that we could afford to continue with diplomacy. As worded in UN resolution 1441 that meant SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. We had already done everything else we could do...what was left but to go to war? Some have argued that there never were any WMD, that Saddam behaved the way he did because it gave him strength with his people because they admired his defiance. However, WMD's are not something to take an action of wait and see. A leader must lead, regardless of the consequences, and must accept his political fate based on the outcome.

Mao killed 38 million human beings, Stalin at least 25 million and Hitler at least 20 million. The figures are there on the CIA website. It is unacceptable to show Stalin and Mao as politicians on Wikipedia website when Hitler is depicted as a monster. All of them were equally monsters and the personal cult communism was no differenct from nazism in essence.  You need to be aware that most former eastern bloc countries banned the use and display of the five-pointed red star and the hammer and sickle symbols of communism alongside the swastika and some local fascist sysmbols, because they know from personal experience that the horrors of stalinism were no less than that of nazism. The hungarian law banning all these is the XLV. (45th) law of 1993, titled ``Az önkényuralmi jelképek használatát tiltó törvény`` and it has been upheld in constitutional court.

"`  You are Stalin apologets. Where is placed the mention of Katyin massacre, where several thousands of polish POVs were shot by NKVD upon Stalin's personal order? We hugarians are very close brothers of the polish people historically, so I find the lack of proper and emphasized mention of Katyin very painful. Stalin's crimes against Poland are amongst the most outrageous in written history. There is no excuse to the Molotov-Rippentropp pact. Make no mistake that was the Hitler-Stalin pact.  I really wish Stalin ruled you, not us. You are like Rumsfeld, who met Saddam during mid-1980s and praised him as a good ally in the anti-Khomeini Iran war. When will you realize that Putyin's current rule is an analog of Stalin's, characterized by extreme disregard for law, anti-semitism (most notably the early 50's doctor trials vs. 2004's Khodorkovski-Yukos) and imperialism (brutal military actions in the Caucasian Mountains both times and desire to the rule neighbours). Thus, by not mentioning Stalins criminality in unambigious terms, you hold the english-speaking world blind to Putyin's methods and you contribute to a ``new Uncle Joe`` sentiment, which will inevitable put the world and the poor Russian race in great danger. A repetition of history for those who refuse to learn about the past.  Stalin started his reign with a few million dead, by reversing Lenin's post-civil-war ``new economic policy`` of limited private agriculture thus leading to big famine.  The entire WWII in Europe would be over in 6-9 months had Stalin failed to entirely decapitate the soviet army's elite in 1937-39, this is clearly written in vol. 2. of soviet published seven-volume ``The history of the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945``. You are plain stupid to praise Stalin for a ``hard earned victory in WWII``.  So powerful was the fear of Stalin's evil power, that even us hungarians, who previously fought three revolutions and independence wars in the last 300 years, did not dare to raise again until autumn 1956 to free ourselves from stalinism. Anglo-saxons betrayed us big time then, shame on the Free World.

"`  == Some things to note about Stalin ==  1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.  2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.  3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by ``kind ol' Uncle Joe`` babble.

I submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures, that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the Jewish population article does both of current and pass population tends. That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.  As an example, being Australian I checked his figure for ``Australian Jews`` in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population. I am afraid this is seems to be another example of where this author has misrepresented certain details to create the illusion that he is scholarly NPOV author. `",0

"`: Yeah, well I enjoy ranting but have gotten to do ever-so-little of it thus far on Wikepedia because of the whole infernal ``Wikiquette`` thing. I couldn't resist the opportunity to indulge a little. ) Here's the dilly (or part of it) on dopamine, melanin and Parkinson's. Dopamine and melanin have very similar structures, and dopamine metabolism produces a form of melanin called ``neuromelanin,`` which is different from eumelanin, pheomelanin, et cetera, but still certainly a melanin. Neuromelanin gradually accumulates in the neurons of the substantia nigra throughout a person's life. Kids have very little, elderly people have lots. When people get Parkinson's they start losing their neuromelanin, and their SN goes pale. The fairly recently-published histology and pathology books I'm using just take it for granted that the loss of neuromelanin is basically a side-effect of dopamine depletion. But I may have been a little too confident in assuming that that's the final word. I just checked the National Library of Medicine website and a bunch of new research is turning up more immediate connections between neuromelanin and Parkinson's than had been suspected. Also, it looks like they're also getting promising results in studies on therapies that involve endocrine manipulation of neuromelanin. Still, all of this specifically involves neuromelanin in the dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and I haven't personally learned, heard or run across anything stating that there is any connection whatsoever between skin melanin and Parkinson's. But I guess the take home message for me is that there is more going on here than I realized, so I can't write off the possibility that there is alsothough I can't imagine howsome emerging connection between neuromelanin/Parkinson's and a person's skin melanin levels. Anyway, as you say, this article is about melanin generally, not just skin melanin in humans, so regardless the Parkinson's link is legit.    `",0

"-  As far as I know ancient Summerian and Babylonian writings conjecture that life might exist off Earth and indeed that aliens may have visted our planet. Seperating practical theorizing from mythologizing is of course difficult with ancient works. Anyhow, this places the idea of extraterrestrial life 3000 to 4000 yrs before the present day. Whether there were earlier theories I don't know. In other places where atronomy was independently invented (India, China etc.) its probably fair to assume that the idea of aliens must have arisen. Note that the five inner planets (excluding Earth) would all have appeared very unique to any society capable of looking at the stars systematically and would long have appeared good candidates for life.

"`Certain none of the responsible people were interested to take credit for those insignificant bridges.  The term ``mukim`` was certain the Malay name for the area smaller than the district level. In Malaysia that term is still in used on the maps. For instance there is a place know as Senai in the State of Johore.On the Map it is listed as Mukim of Senai. The Roman numeric standard was an older form of numbering adopted for used by the the British from the Latin. For instance  I (one) to X (ten), V (five) and III(three). So when the figure of XVIII is exactly 18 by our new standard. Therefore the name Mukim XVIII of Ang Mo Kio signify the area located on the Map. Presently it not the site of the New Town of Ang Mo Kio but just next along side. It was the housing estate built by the United Overseas Land Limited known as ``Faber Gardens``. This was the kampong area where our old attap dwelling used to stand at No. 126 A Lorong Kukus.  In conclusion I suggest that the name of Mukim of Ang Mo kio is far older than the new Town of Ang Mo Kio.

"  Andy, thank you very much! )  What are the locations of those lost buildings?  All in Aachen?  I was wondering if the Holy Roman Empire was supposed to be inclusive for the whole of Western Europe, such as unofficially having traditionally independent places as England and other Catholic lands as subdivisions during that time.  The reason being, that there was only one emperor during those times(in the West) and only after Protestantism did multiple emperors become a feature of Western Europe.  Was the King of England a Sovereign during the time predating the Anglican schism, or was he subordinate to the Holy Roman Emperor?  I postulate this, due to the fact that the Cardinals and Archbishops were subordinate to the Pope and figured that there's some part of history not being told to enough children.  Wouldn't that be a reason to break with the Vatican back then?  Once Henry broke with the Church, he was able to incorporate Wales and the Royal House changed from province to surname.  I was thinking that the provincial royal house like Anjou, Blois or Normandy is a Continental style.  Once England broke away, they went to personal names like Tudor and Stuart...even though Henry was technically of the House of Richmond.  Once England had become the center of another empire, just of its own, they reverted to usage of provincial houses.  So, what do you think...Am I right?",0

"`   == Ward Churchill is Not An Indian == I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all ``Eichmann's.`` Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah `",0

It is written on either the front cover or back cover of his numerous books.  He refers to the fake Indian scam in newspaper article after newspaper article.  He committed fraud when he applied to the University of Colorado.  The Denver Post has published his employment application and on that application he claimed that he is Indian for affirmation action purposes.  That is a damned lie.  There is going to be re-write and Jodi Rave's comments are going back in and all the rest.  Your attempts to stifle the topic has ended by Churchill himself.-   `",0
"  == Some personal observations here: == Put a summary of it into the Roots of Christianity; perhaps a whole subsection thereof.  If the Zoroastrianism part is included, then so must the Egyptian especially since the Hebrews were long associated with Egypt back to the Hyksos invasion.  It would be POV to disclude this factor, considering the trail of monotheism left by Akhenaten and adopted by the Hebrews.  I myself don't know much about Zoroaster, but I certainly recognise much of the Egyptian issue and I'm more of a casual researcher.  It seems to me that Zoroastrian elements are tied to the Persian background, but it would be prejudiced to say that the Egyptians have no basis when they long dominated Palestine.  The Greek Pharaoh himself patroned the Septuagint in Alexandria.  I find the bigotry towards an Egyptian root of Christianity to be entirely unfounded when so much of Egyptian culture was adopted by all peoples in a certain radius outwards.  Perhaps this lies in traditional ideas about race; that the Hamites of Africa have not contributed anything and that the Persians supposedly were/are White or considered Japhethic as opposed to the Semites.  Seriously, this Noahidic classification thing is ridiculous because these Afro-Asiatic people are undoubtedly very much alike and most uninvolved observers would say they are less White than the Greeks and Romans.  I consider Persians to be Semites because they are Asian, in this context.  Give it as much credence as the Persian foundations and you will make this NPOV.  I seriously suggest expounding upon both roots of Christianity and also delineating the Greek root which provided Roman impetus for adoption and proliferation.  For instance, if the Greeks hadn't patroned that religious culture as their relation to Philistines, Rome would have dismissed it as everything else in their cultural relationship with Greece.  Rome even rebuilt Greek Philistia as Palestine and during the Catholic Crusades, it became the Kingdom of Jerusalem.  Christianity has so many dimensions, that it would be haughty to overlook its far ranging origins which even has pagan influences from Europe and Buddhist ties in Southwest Asia.    I myself used to be atheist or Odinist not wanting to deal with what I percieved to be other peoples' culture and now I look in wonder at the historical background of the Sea Peoples and the subsequent Graeco-Roman expansion in the Mediterranean Sea.  There are European roots throughout the region now considered Islamic or Arab, but if we don't provide the means for people to see it we will forget it as much as the terrible destruction of the Library of Alexandria.  Just think of the term Indo-European and you will understand Alexander the Great's empire.  See the connection between the European fylfot and Indian swastika or the Cross and the Ankh?  Please don't demolish this magnificent research, for it has been a great boon in my life to know these things.  I am only stating things as I commonly have studied and heard of them.  I do not propose to limit and debar other positions on this issue, therefore I am not endorsing POV.  The various sources I have seen via Google search appear legitimate and/or sometimes biased(as anything!), but it is not my position to judge the appropriateness of the topic.  We are not to cast a POV on the issue in favour or against, just to deliver as any messenger does.  The existing article on the History of Christianity provides the Persian background but does not give adequate coverage of the Egyptian or Hellenic origins, which are quite prominent.  After all, Christianity had most of its evolution in non-Persian areas of the Mediterranean Sea.  Tell me, how many Persian people are prominent in the Christian world throughout its history?  What fractionary comparison can you draw that factually examines the amount and shows a majority of Persian elements in Christianity, compared to the vast amount of Greek specialty(as written, verified and generally known amongst the entire Christian populace) and the nursery of Christianity itself in Egypt via the Old Testament(even Jesus's infancy was spent in Egypt, in safety from Herod!)?  Please, where is the background of Christianity in Persia besides 19th century racial studies?  Like I've said, the Noahide classification thing has been similarly discredited and its density in weight grew most during that era for Indo-Aryan racist theories.   ",0

Equally, the further criticism of 'creation science' could be applied more widely to creationism as a whole. I am referring here to the sentence, ``Science uses the scientific method to systematically comprehend reality as it is, whereas 'creation science' begins with an assumption and attempts to find evidence or twist facts to support this original assumption.`` ::3 )It is more a critical approach towards creationism, rather than simply 'creation science' that I am advocating. This article is misleading in that it appears to add totally equal merit to both creationism and evolution.

"`  == Pathetic Motorways, and the ``Walton Summit Motorway`` ==  I resent the implication, being the webmaster of the aforementioned site.  The site is not a ``Wacky Website``, but a factually accurate record, with comments tossed in.  You are allowed to educate without boring people, you know!  UncleG is proceeding from a false assumption:  that the classification of all motorways is listed on signposts.  There are many other examples of ``unsigned`` motorways where official DfT documentation exists, such as the tiny A635(M) in Manchester or the A14(M) in Cambridgeshire.  The Walton Summit Motorway is an extremely unusual case.  Whilst it is quite true that there are many short motorway spurs that are simply a part of the ``parent`` motorway, such as the M1 spur at Luton, the Walton Summit Motorway does not fall into this category.  As is clearly pointed out, the Walton Summit Motorway is neither part of the M61, nor part of the M65, but does have motorway classification because it inescapably leads to the roundabout that links the two.  There is no other stretch of motorway in the UK where a short ``spur`` motorway actually links two different motorways.  If it is part of the M65, as the ``start of restrictions`` sign at the bottom of the hill implies, then why does the directional flag sign state ``M61 (M65)``, meaning a part of the M61?  This is a common form of signage throughout the UK system, but is unusual to be found upon a motorway.    A similar item can be seen with reference to the example of the A635(M) above, the ``start of restrictions`` sign when heading westbound on the A635(M) clearly states ``A57(M)``, but the DfT documentation states otherwise. (it's the ``Statutory Instrument 1995 No. 3266 The City of Manchester (Mancunian Way A635(M) and A57(M) Mancunian Way Slip Roads) Special Road Scheme 1992 Confirmation Instrument 1995`` that you're looking for if you're really concerned about its accuracy.  A PDF copy is available on Pathetic Motorways, but a simple Google search will turn up the relevant central government pages if you doubt the source material).  The Walton Summit Motorway is a motorway without a number, hardly an unusual concept in road terms, where most roads either do not possess a classification number, or is of a ``C``, ``D`` or ``U`` classification, which do not appear on road signs.  It is, bowever, an unusual concept in motorway terms.`",0

"  == For Viajero ==  Well, once again you are ignoring several facts about what happened in Peru during those years. Let me explined them to you in a easy way so you can understand a lot better about peruvia politics:  - Fujimori, as President of the Republic, was invited to a asiatic forum that was held in Brunei, 2001. During those days, The Opposition parties manage to impeach Dra. MArtha Hildebrant, President of the Congress and member of Peru 2000, Fujimori´s political Party. It was widely know that they would try to impeach Fujimori from Office. They did it 2 times, and in the last vote (wich was extremely controvertial) they succeded.  - 16 de septiembre: Fujimori llama a nuevas elecciones generales y dice que no participará. (Reuters y Dpa). Fujimori WAS PRESENT in Peru after the Vladi-video.   - Peruvian Congressman Javier Diez Canseco is one of the most untrusted members of this failed parlament. If you didn't know, he was an active member of the EXTREME Left during the times of the Civil War here in Peru. He was involve in several scandals during the 80's for his open suport to Sendero Luminoso. He was in China (representing Peru in that Communist country) at the time of the self-coup, and he lost his seat in the chamber of deputies after that. It is not surpricely that he had exagerated much of the information that he use and his open hate towards the former President is widely know. Besides that, Public enterprises here in Peru where already collapsing becouse of the saturisation of APRA Party Members in those institutions.  - Peru is in resecion for other motives. Since when international financial crisis does not affect some countries? you are ignoring the fact that during 1997 there was also a mayor political crisis her due to the hostages in the Japanese emmbassy.   - The Constitution of 1993 IS NOT retroactive. Fujimori was elected with the 1979 constitution. According to some lawyers, this make him possible to run for a 2th term under that constitution. (he was democraticaly eleccted in 1995 with the 1993 constitution.) It was controvertial, it's true. But most of the power struggle here was caused by the fact that the most important (before the 90's) political parties in Peru were already tired of being ignored by the electorated.  - If you are trying to sell me the idea that the poor terrorist were slaughter with no feeling by the Army, you are completely wrong. May I remind you that it was a war zone? that the poor terrorist where armed with ak-74 and that they have and RPG inside the embassy? Oh, of course that Aministia international will defend them to death, since is their job to do that. I agree with Colombian President Alvaro Uribe when he said that they only care about terrorist and not their victims. once again, this is a patetic effort by yours to rewrite history.  - That order was removed several days latter due to the fact that it created a political storm here, becouse Fomer President Alan Garcia is also accused with the same and is free walking around Lima. Due to political Pressure by the APRA, it was removed, and if you know, that minister was already fire from his post.  Please, read carefully and don't go around trying to rewrite history. We don't forgot ours, but it is sad to see how missinformed can be the world about what really happened here.

Anyhow, I did provide evidence, but I guess your idea of evidence is a photograph or a video tape showing Shahrbanoo being dragged on sand by the Arabs.  So Ali knew Persian, eh?  I suppose you have evidence for this?  The page you asked me to click says Ali knew persian and furthermore it quotes a Shia hadith which claims the following masterpiece of comedy: :Ali, then came up to the princess and asked: ``What is your name?`` The princess replied: ``The daughter of Jahan-shah``. Ali said: ``and so Shahr-banuyeh you will be called`` (``the bride of the land``).  Do you honestly believe that?!  That claim is embarrassingly stupid.  So what evidence you have that Ali knew Persian?  And what evidence you have that Shahrbanoo, who was clearly captured by the Arabs, married Hussayn willingly? Oh, and for your good information, there is plenty of solid historical evidence that her name was Shahrbanoo, and the Arabs didn't gave her that name.  Even if and Arab knew some Persian, what are the chances they knew the difference between the double meaning of ``land/country and city`` for ``shahr``?  At any rate, the Zoroastrians also call her Shahrbanoo, and if her name was given by Ali to her, the Zoros would have referred to her by her original name not by her allegedly Arab given name. Besides, didn't it occur to your brilliant mind that  if Ali was going to give her a name, he would have given her an Islamic name not  a Persian name?   `",0

Anyhow, I will give you a bit of clue free of charge.  The reason there are some favourable Hadiths for Iranians is, surprise surprise, because out of the 6 main Hadith authors, 4 were Iranians, including the 3 most authoritative ones:  Bukhari, Termezi and Hajjaj.  Nasai was also Iranian.  The first 3 were Khurasani, and Nasai was from Pars.  The other 2 Hadith authors are not as major and their works are basically a copy-and-paste from the Hadith of the Iranian authors.  Hajjaj was from Neyshapour but claimed to be of Qushayri origin, so that he was better accepted as some ``real Arab`` from an authentic Arabic origin, but there is academic information that he was indeed of Khorasani origin, and his claim of ``al-Qushayri`` roots is unverifiable.

Obviously he has never read my work.  Most likely he is unfamiliar with the extremely readable and scholarly books of James Webb on occultism, including Nazi permutations of same.  Nazism was clearly based on occultism  evident in every respect from the Thule Society and Theosophical Society roots to the swastika itself.  Hitler did not take his notions from a vaccuum  his notions of ``cleansing actions``, ``master races`` and ``aryanism`` were standard fare in all occult reading  both of Rosicrucians and Theosophists.  As far as left hand swastikas and right hand swastikas are concerned, there are ample books (many of which are in my personal library) showing that it was used interchangeably both ways in both occult and Indian cultures.

Just look at the indexes (and you can do free internet searches):  ``Judaism:  evils of``; ``Judaism, need for dissolution of``.  I have BATTLED Nazism and racism all of my life, starting at age 4 when I told an aunt, ``that man's not bad because he wants to move in your neighborhood.  You're bad because you want to move out just because he's moving in . . .``  Squeakbox owes me an apology.  He confesses he flunked logic.  He also confesses to a closed head injury with a machete type instrument.  For that, I will give him in good Christian style, a charitable interpretation and hope to think that these are his honest interpretations.  Read the New Age books CAREFULLY and not in an altered state  you will find that they are not all peace, light love.  And people who come against them are not ``Nazis``  the kernel of Nazism is the occultism which in its essence spells doom to all who are not blonde, blue-eyed pagans in its ultimate world view.  I have many a New Age book from the early 1980s in my vast personal collection which tells Orientals, Africans, etc., that they should be practicing celibacy as their races are destined to die out anyway.  As regards Solana, he is smart enough to see the Club of Rome agenda for what it clearly is  a global population reduction and occult indoctrination program.

So, if the Bible states in Gen 1:27:   ``So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them,``   and then in Gen 2:7:   ``then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature,``   followed by Gen 2:21:   ``So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.``  These passages contradict one another.  The first states man and woman being created together.  The second two have Adam being created first, followed by Eve.  If a person believes that the Bible is the word of God then both are correct.  So, to make them both correct there has to be a first woman followed by Eve.  Which is how the idea of Lilith came about - filling in the gaps to make both versions true.  If a person believes the Bible is the inspired word of God, written by men capable of error, there is no need for Lilith.         `",0

"`  == More on changes made to ``Early Soviet Rule and World War II section`` ==  I will not respond to the personal attack directed at ``the person who simply reverted this passage...``. As for the substance of the issue:  1. Reasons of Capital move to Kharkov. ProhibitOnions introduced to the article an idea that one of the reasons of the capital move was the fact Kharkov's was more dominated by ethnic Russians than Kiev. This claim has some logic in the context of the events, but I have not seen this claim made in any serious source. If this is due to my ignorance, I suggest ProhibitOnions provides at least some references, or, if he can't find them off hand, at least gives some hints where he saw this info, so that it can be checked. His statement on the talk page that ``many historians concede`` on this is too vague of a reference. If this is indeed his own speculation based on his interpretation of the logic of events, this qualifies as original research, whose place is current scholary or popular publications, personal web-sites, etc., but not an encyclopedia, which should reflect an established knowledge.  2. Possible role of famine in the capital return to Kiev.  PO agrees, that the discussion of the issue belongs to other articles but thinks, it is also relevant here. My point is that this info is factually accurate, but its relevance is too remote. Deliberate killing milions of people was a horrible crime, but Kiev itself, unlike the vast regions of Ukrainian countryside, was not ravaged by famine. Should the info on the deliberate famine caused by the actions of the Bolshevik government be introduced into every article related to any Ukrainian topic? If PO helps me understand why famine should be in Kiev article, I am open to ideas.   3. Finally, PO removed from the article the statement that Kiev growth was mostly caused by migration from other parts of Ukraine which indeed re-established Ukrainian spirit in the city, which is confirmed, for example, by a relative rise of Ukrainian theater and literature in Kiev at the time. He substituted it by the statement about ``the migration from other parts of the Soviet Union.`` Where does he get this info?  The changes he introduced seem ideological rather that relevant and I reverted them once.

"`  == Kosebamse's anti-Cubic crusade == Kosebamse, firstly, explain how my comment regarding Cubic implications of Occam's razor was ``frivolous`` and ``betrays the quality of your argumentation``.  Secondly, you demand testable predictions. I will firstly point out that most theories have values other than the capacity to predict the outcome of experiments. Had relativity been formulated only after all its implications had been verified, it would still be used widely, but for such practical uses as technology development and simulation. As such, to determine a theory's practical value, we must focus on its real-life ramifications  testable hypotheses, but not necessarily predictions.  From the fundamental Cubic principles, we may broadly define manifestations of Cubic geometry evident in reality. Firstly, that everything is cyclical. In the case of large-scale phenomena, such as cyclicality of galaxy death and rebirth, and that of the universe as a whole, our observational capabilities may not suffice; but on smaller scales, cyclicality certainly is measurable.  A second observable influence is the life that has evolved on Earth, representing an interaction between chaos and Time Cube. Cubic properties are evident in lifeforms  see and Pyramidal Lifeforms, and Systems and Complexities in Nature.`",0
"  ::::Scott, if that's you, you need to sign your comments.  Duff doesn't use any string theory, not one spit, to argue his point.  Scott, i think that is evidence that you still just don't get it.  this has nothing to do with string theory.  string theory is non-sequitur.  i hardly understand string theory (really, just the pop stuff Brian Greene puts on Nova), but i fully understand the argument that, in reality, the only physical quantities that we measure, that we perceive, that make any difference to anything that involves us as human beings (or E.T. beings, for that matter) are dimensionless quantities.  when something changes that affects us, ultimately it's a dimensionless measure, usually the ratio of like dimensioned quantities.  we always measure a dimensionful quantity against another like dimensioned quantity.  ::::if  changed (let's say got bigger), conceptually, that would have meaning, the electromagnetic force (relative to the other fundamental interactions) would have changed in proportion (gotten a little bigger).  then it would appear that the charge of an electron has gotten a little bigger (but it might not have) or that Planck's constant has gotten a little smaller (but it might not have) or that the speed of light has gotten a little smaller (that's the choice you and authors such as Moffat made) or even (if we're gonna say that  might have changed) that the permittivity of free space has changed (like ,  is defined in many measurement systems, such as SI or cgs).  (i doubt anyone will argue that it's  or  that has changed.)  heck, someday soon (i would expect within a decade)  will be defined (because of a redefinition of the kilogram).  if they do that, then a change in  gets blamed on a change of , which still seems most natural to me, but that's my opinion.  even so,. if they did that to  and  was measured to have changed, i would not argue that all of the electrons and protons and positrons in the universe have somehow transferred charge.  i would say that they appear to have a different charge since their strength of their interaction has changed (which is fundamentally all a change in  can mean).  that is all we would know or could ever know.  to blame any conceptual change of  on a change of any of the dimensionful ingredients to it, is silly.

"`  == Wikipedia ``Patricia Cornwell`` page libelous, being used for felony fraud crimes ==  The main Wikipedia ``Patricia Cornwell`` page is not only libelous, defamatory, false and misleading, but it is also being used to support felony crimes of fraud and extortion. The page itself is a felony criminal act of obstruction of justice, because it uses the Wikipedia public forum to give a false report of previously committed crimes. Wikipedia contributors may face felony indictment as well as civil charges by maintaining these materials online.  Demand is hereby made that you stop these criminal acts on the Wikipedia site, and that you remove the libelous, defamatory, false, fraudulent and misleading material that violates Wikipedia's own policies.  The page is the alleged biography page for author Patricia Cornwell, a page which appears to have been seized by partisans under Cornwell's influence or on her payroll. These partisans have authored false and fraudulent material, and reject and delete factual material that displeases Cornwell.  I am Patricia Cornwell's leading biographer, and also one of many victims of crimes committed by Cornwell.  The Wikipedia main page on Cornwell is a brief piece of pro-Cornwell propaganda, which hides and falsifies her long life of multiple scandals. A large part of the page is a libelous attack on myself, with a criminally fraudulent report of the crimes Cornwell committed against me.  As shown in court filings and public documents, Cornwell hired thugs to threaten to have me illegally jailed and murdered, and funded a fraud scheme in a Southern court to try and ban my freedom of speech. Your Wikipedia page falsifies the report of these crimes, and mounts a highly personal libelous attack against me.  Patricia Cornwell is a longtime friend of the President Bush family and some FBI agents, and has used these connections to escape prosecution for a series of crimes and offenses, clearly evident in public records and court documents.  Your Wikipedia page, seemingly written under the sway of the criminal Cornwell, hides the real facts about her life. A few words of sycophantic praise for Cornwell, and then a brief section on ``Controversies`` which ignores her actual huge history of scandals that is evident from court records and published articles, like when Cornwell was sued for stealing the private autopsy reports of murdered children and copying them nearly verbatim into her novels.  You are invited to read Cornwell's genuine biography, widely available online, ``Patricia Cornwell Biography: Crime, Bribery, Scandal and Mental Illness``. Researchers can already have an advance copy of my upcoming biography book on Cornwell, which extensively quotes primary sources and which can background a Wikipedia article to replace the libelous propaganda you have now.  It seems the main purpose of your current short Wikipedia Cornwell ``biography`` page is to launch a libelous attack on myself, to try and discredit my work and my upcoming major book on Cornwell.  I have tried to begin to edit out the falsehoods and fraudulent statements in your article, but the Cornwell partisans who control the Wikipedia page immediately re-installed the pro-Cornwell lies and libelous propaganda.  The specific attacks on me in your Wikipedia article, are direct propaganda in line with Cornwell's hired thugs. Regarding the specifics of these false statements:  The article accuses me of making public ``plagiarism`` accusations about Cornwell, regarding a book that she delayed and re-wrote after my private protests. The Wikipedia statements are false, deceptive and misleading. The Wikipedia claims are propaganda, originally laid out by the Cornwell lawyers to set up the lawsuit to ban my freedom of speech, propaganda they set out in a fraudulent article that, as documents show, was planted in the Republican Richmond Times-Dispatch newspaper by the Cornwell lawyers themselves. The Times-Dispatch is a newspaper closely tied to Patricia Cornwell, and the ``reporter`` who wrote the fraudulent article never met me and never interviewed me.  The actual facts are that I publicly criticized neo-Nazi activities by Cornwell, her written threats advocating book-burning and the banning of free speech, and her demands that I be totally silent about her. The Cornwell lawyers have tried to pretend that the controversy was instead about accusations of ``plagiarism`` after Cornwell already re-wrote her book, accusations they themselves fabricated to distract from the real issues.  The Wikipedia article sneers about the absence of major similarities between Cornwell's book and my earlier novel. But it does not disclose the fact that Cornwell re-wrote and revised her book substantially after my private protests over her announced stor",0

First, ``typically`` and ``generally`` are weasel words.  This definition represents RJII's point of view, and violates our neutral poiint of view.  Second, I do not agree that capitalism is an economic system; there are many scholars who argue that it is not an economic system, and an NPOV description of capitalism can't make an assertion that represents one point of view.  Third, there are non-capitalist societies where the means of production are privately owned, and some scholars argue that capitalism threatens the private ownership of capital, so again this definition is inaccurate or at best violates NPOV policy.  Fourth, it is just poorly written, the second and third clauses are redundant.  Fifth, it leaves out what many consider the defining feature of capitalism, which is the commoditization of labor.

"`  :Aha! So Kayla and Kailina are the same; but there's more to be explained. After checking some more sources I think we can be sure of the existence of at least two separate Agaw dialects/languages (just like Bender 1976:8 says; but unlike Ethnologue and Sommer 1992): first, Qemant-Kemant-Chemant-Kamant-Kimantinya-Kimanteney, and secondly Kayla-Kaila-Kailinya (ethnonym Betə Israel (cf. Mann & Dalby 1987:16), xenonyms Falasha/Felasha from Ge'ez 'immigrant, stranger'; Yihudi (cf. Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992). Kemant could be extinct by now (Sommer 1992 mentions that ``according to Gamst, Kemant is threatened by extinction``). In any case, a huge language shift is going on here; all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue, only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left, out of an ethnic group of about 170,000 people in 1998. Endangered, to say the least. :Quirin (1998) leads me to believe that an important reason for Qemant and Kayla being separate languages is that their speakers (coming from a common Agaw base) developed separate identities from the beginning of the 14th century on. However, apparently there's a lot of fuss going on in Beta Israel historiography (cf. e.g. ) and I don't know enough about it at present to judge sources like this (though Qurin seems to have done his homework). :Anyway, a third dialect seems to be Qwera/Quara/Qwarina/'Kara of Kwarasa'/Hwara/Hwarasa; this one appears to be extinct (cf. Ethnologue). It seems to have been related more closely to Qemant — Gamst (p.c. to Sommer, Sommer 1992:358) proposes that ``Quara, Quarinya, spoken by a few Falasha in Quara (to the west of Qemant-land), is nearly the same language as Qemant.`` :I've listed my sources below; we'll probably be able to use them in some of the articles. —     :*Bender, M.

"`  == Stub sorting guidelines == I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline.  I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow.  Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines.  We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration.  I thank  for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything.  For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on.  The English Wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles.  Either the MediaWiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians.  Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the Wikipedia out, performance wise.  Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand.     ==That thing you did== ‘’Hi Gadfium - a while back I was having trouble with some geography stubs, and (via the Village Pump) you found out for me that they'd been created twice, and fixed them.

The rules of scientific classification require a description of an individual specimen of the species. In 1993, Robert Bakker formally described the skull of paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in an attempt to make Cope the type specimen for Homo sapiens. Despite current requirements that the specimen be available to the describing scientist (Cope was born in 1840 and the scientist who described and published Homo sapiens, Carolus Linnaeus, did so in 1758), it is unclear as to the lack of validity of Bakker's publication and many consider Cope to be the type specimen.  The mental ability of humans and their intelligence make them, according to Pascal, the most sad creatures of all animals. The ability to have feelings, such as sadness or happiness, distinguish them from the other organisms, even if this assertion can be hardly proved with animal tests. Humans' existence, according to most philosophers, configures itself as the search of happiness.  ==References== We have a short list of references in the References section, but with no indication in the text which points they were sources for; and the inline references we do have are not listed under References.

"` ::``Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/botanists by nationality lists a 4-4 vote, which is hardly a consensus to make the changes you did. Some of the categories you emptied have been around for six months at least, such as British botanists, so it wasn't just an anon (who was most likely  logged out, as the software is wont to do). Although I understand that you personally think nationality is unimportant, that is just your POV; for a high-school teacher in New Zealand or Brazil looking up homegrown botanists for the class to write about, that is quite relevant, and nearly impossible to find out without the subcategories. In any case, you're setting yourself against the hundreds of editors who have built Category:Nationalities by occupation and Category:People by nationality and their thousands of subcategories. Either botanists are fundamentally different from other kinds of people (which could be argued I suppose -) ), or all these other editors are mistaken, in which case you should convince them of their wrongness first before unilaterally emptying out the category. But given that Category:American actors alone has some 3,000 names, I don't think you're going to get much of a favorable hearing! If you want to argue that the botanists is still too small to be subdivided, that's plausible, but your argument seems to be that the category shouldn't be subdivided no matter how large it gets. Just as you expect other people to defer to your knowledge in matters arboreal, you should respect those who are more knowledgeable about information organization.  `` :::Hi Stan - several points; first, neither was there any consensus for Pcpcpc's (if they were his) changes in the first place; I was restoring the original status quo, not making a change. And no request for comment had been made at either WP:TOL talk or from regular botanical contributors, as should have been done, before making that change. Second, botanists are fundamentally different from (almost) all other kinds of people when it comes to nationality; e.g. uniquely only botanists and ornithologists working in Britain and Germany among all people maintained friendly communication and exchange of scientific information throughout the second world war. Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist's wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don't, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118's and Pcpcpc's contributions lists, that they've not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~  `",0

In looking through the historical record at the competition between creation and evolution in Darwin's day, I was impressed by Thomas Huxley's 1887 account of how Origin of Species provided the first explanation that in Huxley's view was a better explanation than creation.  Huxley describes the sense in which he rejected creation as an explanation.  :If Agassiz told me that the forms of life which had successively tenanted the globe were the incarnations of successive thoughts of the Deity; and that he had wiped out one set of these embodiments by an appalling geological catastrophe as soon as His ideas took a more advanced shape, I found myself not only unable to admit the accuracy of the deductions from the facts of paleontology, upon which this astounding hypothesis was founded, but I had to confess my want of any means of testing the correctness of his explanation of them. And besides that, I could by no means see what the explanation explained.   Huxley describes his similar rejection of the explanations of the evolutionists prior to Darwin.  :And, by way of being perfectly fair, I had exactly the same answer to give to the evolutionists of 1851-8. . . . [A] thorough-going evolutionist, was Mr. Herbert Spencer, whose acquaintance I made, I think, in 1852. . . . Many and prolonged were the battles we fought on this topic. But even my friend's rare dialectic skill and copiousness of illustration could not drive me from my agnostic position. I took my stand upon two grounds: firstly, that up to that time, the evidence in favor of transmutation was wholly insufficient; and, secondly, that no suggestion respecting the causes of the transmutation assumed, which had been made, was in any way adequate to explain the phenomena. Looking back at the state of knowledge at that time, I really do not see that any other conclusion was justifiable.   Furthermore, any self-respecting religion-neutral anthropologist, such as Robert L. Carneiro, Curator of the American Museum of Natural History, would classify creation and evolution as mere successive stages of incomplete but improving explanations in a universe where there is no God to assist the women and men who attempt to discover the truth of their origins.   From all of the above, I suggest that it is more accurate to define creationism as an explanation rather than a belief.  After all, the survival of the belief derives from the usefulness of the belief, and a primary use of creationism is explaining how we all got here.  According to Thomas Huxley, until Origin of Species, creationism was as good an explanation as evolutionism.  And for the majority of American voters who cannot understand the evolutionists' explanations, creationism is a better explanation than evolutionism even yet today.  -   : Considering that ``Belief in the psychological sense is a representational mental state that takes the form of a propositional attitude and in the religious sense, belief refers to a part of a wider spiritual or moral foundation, generally called faith, and that creationism is part and parcel of the christian faith, I think the use of the term ``belief`` was completely justified. Creationism is indeed an explanation, but it is an explanation founded on belief, hence it is a belief. It is not founded on knowledge or evidence; to imply otherwise, which is what you're doing, is to create a false impression that Creationism shares some sort of parity with other explanations which do not require belief in the supernatural. It does not. You seem to be substituting your own personal bias for this imputed ``evolutionist bias`` you claim is on the Creationism page.    -  ``Personal bias``?  Nope.  I have b",0

It could also be a matter of renaming articles to the most accepted NPOV term, and having appropriate redirects.  I agree that substance abuse is a more correct title for the article, but then such an article (substance abuse) should also include information on alcohol abuse, which currently has its own page as alcoholism.  The drug addiction page has some POV problems.  What should be done here is to leave 'drug addiction' itself under the domain of Addiction, and rename the drug addiction page (with all its references to brain chemistry, and method of action) to Drug dependence.  Anything addiction specific should be moved to the addiction page.  I'm more of an advocate of giving separate topics their own pages of proper NPOV naming (even if they are stub articles) as long as those pages are well linked into from relevant pages.  My vote would be to make substance abuse it's own page talking about substance abuse in general, and have it reference other pages talking about specifics of chronic abuse the different substances (i.e. alcoholism).  Specifics of problems with certain substances can have their own pages.  I'm certain that all the individual drug pages have plenty of information that can be moved off to specific abuse pages.  I'm certain that some will be opposed to separating the ``good and the bad`` of different substances into regular pages and abuse pages (consider Alcohol > Alcoholic beverage > Alcoholism), but if alcohol is treated that way, then other substances deserve the same consideration.  If people disagree, then I'd argue that the alcoholism and alcoholic beverage pages should likewise be combined.   `",0

I've done my best to integrate it, but someone may want to take an editorial pass. Also, it seems to me that we ought to have several ``sidebar`` articles dealing with things like the internal situations in Madrid and Barcelona during the war and there should probably be a lot on Spanish anarchism and the various plitical parties of the time that either exists and should be linked to, or doesn't and should be written.     Could someone please explain the communism vs civilization comment in the intro? Thanks. - , 2004-03-14t09:29z : An atttribution would certainly be nice, and I didn't put it there, but it's certainly on the mark as to how some viewed it. I've seen Hearst Movietone newsreels from the period, and that is pretty much the picture they present. It's also the rhetoric to be found in Franco's speeches during the war. It had very little basis in reality, in my opinion, but leaned heavily on communist atheism and anitclericalism, and the destruction of churches (and  in some cases  torture, murder, etc. of clergy and members of monastic orders) that occurred in the opening weeks of the war. I think the article is accurate in saying that the atrocities in those opening weeks were roughly equal, but the fact that many on the Republican side targeted the Church was endlessly exploited in the Nationalists' rhetoric, and struck a note with conservatives elsewhere who otherwise might have kept more distance from fascism.     ==Pro-Nationalist link== I for one am inclined to keep, for the moment, the recently added Professor Marek Jan Chodakiewicz on The Spanish Civil War. There ought to be at least one external link to a site more sympathetic to the Nationalists than to the Republic. However, I don't think it is a particularly good site: there must be a far more comprehensive presentation of this case (maybe even with some decent footnotes and/or external references itself?) elsewhere on the web. If someone could find a better one and substitute it, I think that would be an improvement.     === Not Neutral === I added the note ``The neutrality of this article is disputed.`` because of the insistence in that General Franco or his forces were fascist. This is just communist propaganda. We know better now. Communists wanted to overthrow the legal system of liberties in Spain to create a system similar to that of the Soviet Union. General Franco and his coup prevented that. Of course, the Republican legality was not restored, but that was because it had not proven safe from revolutionary risks. And Monarchy was not restored probably because King Alfonso XIII fled the country only because his partisans lost a municipal ballot, so it appeared to the victors in the war that that king was not reliable to grant individual rights. Of course, Franco's Dictatorship is more than objectionable, but it does not prove that it was a fascist regime.  (this was unsigned, but it's   : Frankly, I think this one characterization does not make a non-neutral article. I disagree with much of what Makjavelo has just written, but I do agree with him that the article (or maybe an associated article) might gain from a more extensive explanation of the somewhat complicated relationship of Franco's politics (and Falangism in general) to fascism as such.     : This seems like petty apology for Franco, in my opinion. Not only the communists, but the anarchists, socialists and most Republicans refered to the Francoist forces as ``fascist;`` as well as many historians and authors, e.g. Hemingway.

Same thing for Peking and Nanking. When you pronounce them in French, Italian, they sound more like the original Cantonese vernacular variant.

Traditionally, foreign names are transliterated into Chinese ideographs by whichever vernacular group that first settled there. In USA and Europe, it is mostly by the Cantonese, then subsequently The Minnan-Taiwanese and recently the people for Fuzhou, Wenzhou etc. As such, they will use Han ideographs to represent the sounds they transliterate from the foreign language like English. There is no standardised version until the Northerners came into power and imposed Mandarin on all the other Chinese groups for the noble mission of reuniting the motherland against foreign invaders through bettering communication. I think the best way to transliterate and reflect the diversity of Chinese culture is to put the actual foreign name first, i.e. the ORIGINAL, followed by the oldest transliteration (in chronology) and finally the Mandarin version. That will make it easy for everyone cos then the eyes will zoom right to the end for the contemporary Mandarin pronunciation and zoom right to the first line for the original and if readers have time, they can trace the colorful history of transliteration and migration by reading the chronology of changes. Thank you for being so interested in Chinese culture. We need more friends like you. Have a nice day.   ",0

"  ==  == My first hand dissapointing experience with the movement == ==    I have been to several Larouche meetings and I find it very interesting that the Larouche Movement advocates that we non-members are conditioned by fear (especially baby boomers) not to join their fight when on the contrary they use nothing but catastrophic speculations as recruitment. Larouche has been propagating perpetual nuclear warfare and the collapse of the economy for decades. I have personally been told that I would work at Starbucks after my degree (I have a well paying successful job today), the economy will collapse within a year (this was told to me a few years ago), and I was shown pictures of soldiers being hanged referring personally to my faith if I had not joined their fight to stop it.   You see, by joining this movement, members take a leap over all their earthly problems by being placed in purposeful positions to save the world and receive immortality of the soul in return. Which depressed kid would not want to be placed into that fantasy world. The lonely recruits receive brotherhood; the ones who have failed in life are given intellectual reverence surmounting any non-larouchie, that’s a good opiate receptor! Many of these recruits come into the movement as empty slates to be filled up with Larouche tactics, this is why the Larouche YOUTH Movement has been the biggest sector in their existence. This is also a reason Larouche recruiters blatantly challenge their contacts not to listen to their parents, professors, or any adults with the explanation that they have become forever impudent by fear through degenerate cultures that us kids still have a chance to overcome.   1) They believe in aristocracy, as their beloved and foundation, Plato does. It's interesting how their cause is to invest in the potential of every single human mind when their political system would be setup to discount and make decisions for the non-aristocrats, which would be us weaklings. And before one of you fresh Larouchie's claims this is not true, it had been recorded in a briefing.   2) They want you to drop out of school because classes are setup as a 1-way channel between teacher and students, rather than, a pedagogue where everyone can facilitate the exchange of diverse ideas. I find this most interesting when i was accused of being a British operative in my attempt to exchange the ideas of philosophers and economic theories they were never exposed to. During a meeting my questions were brushed off and not answered, the speaker called them ‘academic’. The Larouche Movement is so organized that he has already conditioned his youth to negate any wake-up theories or opposing ones to be that of British conspiracy against mankind. In conclusion, this is no place to exchange ideas as they preach it is, it’s exchanging Larouche ideas or nothing.   3) Larouche writes thousands of pessimistic speculations, and when one inevitably hits, he is plumed to be always right as the others are forgotten. The speculations that are forgotten are thrown under the umbrella of economic collapse and perpetual warfare with only the future to hold the truth. Just read Larouche writings, he tells you that he is the ONLY ONE in the WORLD who can save us from these disasters. His intent and cause seem great, but what does his character tell you about the underpinnings; his Will to Impose himself on others? It is so blatant that even the purblind can see the egotistical style in his writings, remember, this is called the LAROUCHE Movement.   4) Larouche recruiters insult your way of living opposed to the thinkers, the ones who spend their time developing their minds in the movement. If the Larouchie’s are our saviors, if they are the brains of our renaissance, or even the brains of the world, studying Larouche mathematics, science, literature, philosophy, politics. Well how come none of the members ever made an invention or real impact. They really can use some invention to boost their popularity and finances. The reason this has not occurred is a great irony; these members are not self thinkers, they are followers, they study only Larouche and even with that knowledge they are too conditioned for Larouche to make new inferences.    All this studying and organizing only embeds the shackles on their minds. It is very unfortunate, because these members truly become psychologically stuck in the movement. It is very hard for one to admit to the Self that all these years were a waist of time and they must now step back to the miserable status of earthly life they left off at. This, accompanied with the fact that these members breathe Larouche 24/7, is why they will and are stuck beyond all fathomable realizations of the world.         ",0

"`  == Question about number of edits ==  Hello, since the welcome message to my talk page came from you, I presume you're the person I should turn to with any questions.  I notice that every time anyone makes a change in an article, the old and new versions are stored in the history page.  I'm not terribly computer literate, but it seems that that would take up a lot of space, and I presume Wikipedia doesn't have infinite webspace.  If I see an incorrect comma in the third paragraph, a spelling error in the fifth, an incorrect link in the sixth, an incorrect date in the eighth, and unclear wording in the thirteenth, does Wikipedia prefer that I do one big edit so that it will have only one new page to store, or is it okay to save as I go along?  Are the individual versions in the history page deleted after a certain length of time?  I've been editing my user page, and just wonder whether I should leave changes until I have something big to change.  Thanks     : (Butting in here, again, as people ask more interesting questions on Mel's talk page than on mine).  Ann, firstly, diskspace is so incredibly cheap that you could type flat out for your whole life and you wouldn't fill a drive that cost 100 euros;  so don't worry about diskspace.  This issue of what to do in an individual edit is one purely for the convenience of other people who are reading it.  So if you're doing a bunch of fairly trivial tweaks (fixing grammar, spelling, formatting, etc) then do all of those in one go (and give an edit summary like ``various grammar and spelling tweaks``.  If the article needs tweaks and also need a higher-level change (adding or removing a big chunk of text, fixing some wording that you thing is seriously incorrect or misreading) then do the trivial fixes in one edit, and the other fix in another (with an edit summary like ``removing nonsense about Father Dougal``).  So (in summary) make changes based on what is a logical unit, not what's convenient for the software.    |    (Thanks for this; I've copied it to Ann Heghan's Talk page)    `",0

" :From Nuclear explosion: ::In 1945 there was some initial speculation among the scientists developing the first nuclear weapons that there might be a possibility of igniting the earth's atmosphere with a large enough nuclear explosion.

"  :That's a very fair question. The answer is that there have been several court cases in which this very dispute has been at issue – besides George Harrison's 19th-century case, the main recent test case is that of Tim Saunders (around 1980ish? – I've got the date somewhere or other), who argued he didn't have to pay the poll tax because the Stannary Parliament had vetoed it in Cornwall. His case was thrown out, so the dispute remains unsettled. Besides the revived Stannators themselves, I'd actually suggest the people of Cornwall as a whole are party to the debate – and I don't just say this as a Cornish nationalist, Britain's a democracy, so its constitutional questions are a concern of the people. :There's also a sense in which it doesn't matter whether Cornwall is an ordinary county or not, and that is the question of whether we should think of Cornwall as part of England in any kind of non-legal sense. Think about the status of Merionethshire in the 1880s. Legally it was just an ordinary county of England-and-Wales; yet it clearly belonged to a specific 'country', if you like, namely Wales. Conceivably, then, Cornwall could be (legally) an ordinary county of England-and-Cornwall, but a 'country' of its own in a different way. :I know what you mean, in a sense – it doesn't seem like much of a dispute if Cornwall County Council isn't taking part.

By ``dialect`` Swedish dialectologists are refering to those local dialects [``bygdemål``, ``landsmål``] that have a straight lineage that can be traced back to Old Norse, a history shared with all other Scandinavian dialects - these form a continuum while the distinct ``national languages`` like Swedish, Danish and Norweigan are relativly recent constructions.  :This is confirmed by Claes-Christian Elert (professor of phonetics at Umeå University 1969-1988) in ``Allmän och svensk fonetik`` (``General and Swedish phonetics``) on pages 34-35. Here are some selected passages (again my translation):  ::For a long time there has existed speech varieties within the Swedish language area which are used only in certain communities and which have only been slightly influenced by the spoken varieties of central Sweden or by the written language. These are the genuine dialects [the bold font is in the book].  ::[...]  ::The variety of language that a visitor to a community encounters most of the time is not the genuine dialect but a reginal speech variety [again Elert's bolding]. Sometimes the standard language is spoken with regional influences. Contrary to the genuine dialects, the regional varieties are almost identical to the central standard language [``det centrala riksspråket``] in terms of inflection and syntax. Vocabulary is usually also more or less identical, though some local deviations do exist. It is above all the pronunciation of vowels and consonants as well as prosody of the regional variations that deviate from the standard language. Generally these are similar to the genuine dialects within the same region. The regional standard varieties do not differ as much from one community to another as the genuine dialects.  :If you interpret these quotes very generously (that is, not according to what the writers intended), you might be able to support SIL's claims, though not the figures. The claims that Scanian as a regional variety is a seperate language is supported only by Lång and a handful of Scanian regionalists who use completely bogus arguments  and often claim the name should be skåneländska (roughly ``Terra Scanian``). That it would be a dialect of only Danish is also extremely speculative, and it should at the very least be classified as simply ``East Scandinavian``. For all practical purposes it is most likely a lot more easily understood by Swedes than Danes.  : `",0

Or the versions in Egypt and Yemen, which have (at least at this point) more to do about making sure that the only version of Islam practiced is the state-sponsored one.

"`  :The thing is, just because some nomenclature has a historical POV does not mean that it has a current POV.  For example, I can use the terms Holy Roman Empire, Thursday, or Queen Elizabeth II without implying that I believe that the empire was holy, or that I worship the Norse god of thunder, or that I recognize the authority of the British monarch.  (Interesting note about the Quakers in the Thursday article though: should we scrub Wikipedia of ``Thursday``?)  Regardless of the historical origins of the abbreviations BC and AD, they now mean little more than indicating the point at which the English-speaking world stops counting years backward and starts counting them forward.  Seriously, how many people read ``BC`` and think that the Messiahship of Jesus is being proclaimed?  Or that AD means they accept Jesus as Lord?  Construing BC and AD as statements of religious devotion may have been valid when the terms were first introduced, but to reject BC and AD now in the face of centuries of tradition and widespread usage seems to be justifiable only under two premises: either (1) that any term with historical origins in religious devotion carries an eternal POV taint and should be excised from Wikipedia, or (2) that the abbreviations still so strongly communicate religious meaning to the majority of users as to make the terminology indeed POV.  The first premise is itself POV (by singling out religion as an unacceptable originator of terminology), and thus should not justify rejecting BC/AD.  The second premise, though is where I think Slrubenstein and others are coming from (do correct me if I'm wrong).  If this premise can be validated, then the POV-ness of BC/AD is established, and use of these abbreviations should be abandoned throughout Wikipedia in favor of BCE/CE.  On the other hand, if BC/AD is shown not to convey religious meaning to the majority of Wikipedia users, then it should be the favored usage in most articles based on its familiarity to readers.  Perhaps another poll could be taken to address the simple yes/no question: Does modern usage of BC/AD convey a religious point of view to you?  Assuming a sufficiently representative response by Wikipedians, the results may be a better indication of how to resolve this controversy than simply asking for people's preferences between BC/AD and BCE/CE.  `",0

"  Update:  May 13, 2005:  SqueakBox has made damaging inferential admissions on my own blogspot, www.cumbey.blogspot.com that he fabricated items in various stories he has composed about Javier Solana either here or on his various other internet stalkings seeking to erase all negative references to Javier Solana on the whole worldwide web (a daunting and challenging task!).  He now admits he invented the story about Solana being considered the friendliest child in his grade school class.  I was quite surprised to learn this as I honestly thought maybe SqueakBox had information which could be useful to me in the book I am writing about Javier Solana as well as my Wikipedia contributions and blogspot articles.  I asked him for his source and he publicly posted that he got it from the same place as I got that Ariel Sharon refused to meet with Solana.  The problem with this is that Ariel Sharon really did refuse to meet with Javier Solana and SqueakBox deleted that reference from Wikipedia and defamed me all over the web by falsely claiming I had fabricated that information.

J'accuse SqueakBox of intellectual dishonesty to the detriment of Wikipedia and I will be seeking to have him permanently banned from Wikipedia.

I just object to statements like, the entirety of space-time came into existence at some point, unless you define this point embedded in a larger space-time outside of our own. The fallacy comes from implying that both the statements, space-time is everything, and something exists outside of space-time, are true. However, I work in computer software and don't do physics (although this is really about philosophy), so maybe I'm just using the the wrong kind of logic?    ::If time is finite, then there must be a beginning (which is what I think is meant by ``at some point``).

I wasn't really comfortable with the version that came before it, though.  First cause is a complex topic, or at least a lot has been said about it, and the previous version of the paragraph was presenting a rather severe dichotomy.

"`By the grace of G-d Shalom everyone! The category ``Noahide Religions`` is extreemly misleading Rambam doesn't say Muslims are Noahide just not idolworshipers.A Noahide (Ben Noah, Chasid Umot haOilam) according to Rambam and others is someone who officialy accepts the 7 Laws and observes them.According to letters of the Rambam Islam is herecy, a false religion started by a false prophet: Mohammed the False Prophet - Islam the False Religion   Rivka Olenick    ``A prophet will the Lord, thy God raise unto thee, a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren.`` Deuteronomy 18:15  The false prophet, the navi sheker, the ``madman`` Mohammed, as the Rambam calls him, convinced his followers of Islam that there are several verses in our scriptures that allude to his being a prophet. The Rambam states: ``These arguments have been rehearsed so often that they have become nauseating. It is not enough to declare that they are altogether feeble; to cite as proofs these verses is ridiculous and absurd in the extreme. Neither the untutored multitude nor the apostates themselves who delude others with them believe in them or entertain any illusion about them. Their purpose in citing these verses is to win favor in the eyes of the Gentiles by demonstrating that they believe the statement of the Koran that Mohammed was mentioned in the Torah. The Muslims themselves put no faith in their arguments, they neither accept nor cite them, because they are manifestly so falicious.``  Mohammed claimed that Deuteronomy 18:15 specifically refers to him. He said that it was he who God arose as ``a prophet from the midst of thee.`` Of course, he himself nor anyone else ever found one word in the scriptures that proved that Mohammed arose as a prophet. Yet, he and his blind followers accuse us of manipulating the text of the Torah. They ignorantly claim that we purposely removed every trace of the name of Mohammed from it. However it was they that would not accept the main precepts of the Torah, out of defiance to the Revelation at Sinai. So in great desperation they created a book that horrendously warps and taints our scriptures and undermines Moses as the greatest Prophet. After all this they attempted to legitimize the Koran as a book of truth.  Isn't it amazing that exactly what they accuse us of - ``altering`` the Torah text - is exactly what they altered when they made up this ``imitation`` and called it the Koran. What they believe is so obviously false, yet the world is convinced that this is a book of truth only because of the vast numbers who read it, and not because it contains any real truth. The Rambam says: ``Therefore, all the nations instigated by envy and impiety rose up against us, and all the kings of the earth motivated by injustice and enmity applied themselves to persecute us.`` There arose a new sect, which combined the two methods of conquest and controversy, into one, because it believed that this procedure would be more effective in wiping out every trace of the Jewish nation and religion. They claimed to prophecy and found a new faith, Islam, contrary to the Divine religion and to contend that it was equally God given. Thereby it hoped to raise doubts and create confusion, since one is opposed to the other and both supposedly emanate from a Divine source, which would lead to the destruction of both religions. For such a remarkable plan contrived by a man who is envious and querulous. He will strive to kill his enemy and to save his own life, but when he finds it impossible to attain his objective, he will devise a scheme whereby they both will be slain.`` He slays them both because he really knows that he cannot destroy God, but he cannot tolerate God's Divine word and so out of his own insanity he kills those who represent God and kills himself believing he will enter paradise.  The Torah states that the prophet that will arrive ``from the midst of thee`` is a person that will keep the Torah in tact as it was given to us by Moses from God. The Ninth Principle of our Thirteen Principles of Faith states: ``I believe with perfect faith that the Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be another Torah given by God.`` As it says: ``Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.`` Deuteronomy 13:1.  ``A prophet will the Lord thy God raise unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren.`` Islam took this sentence completely out of context and made inferences. All the statements before and after must be understood so that the meaning and purpose of the statements is known. The sentence quoted above was taken from a paragraph in Deuteronomy that specifically warns the Jewish people about the prohibitions of soothsaying, astrology, divination, sorcery, etc. The Gentiles believe they can manipulate and use these practices in ord",0

"` 2005 (UTC)  ::To say that ``Britain headed the Commonwealth`` is simply wrong and it represents a misunderstand of what the Commonwealth was and is. onec again: Britain and the Dominions (or later Commonwealth realms) were considered to be equals in the Commonwealth (whereas British India, in 1939, and the crown colonies were not). Hence the Dominions declared war independently of Britain in 1939 (and the Irish Free State, which was a Dominion at the time, remained neutral). Britain is not even a ``first among equals``. That is the difference between the Commonwealth of Nations and the British Empire. In fact, for most of the war, the vast majority of Australian forces served under Douglas MacArthur in the South West Pacific Area, rather than under British commanders anywhere else.   ::Similarly it is a misrepresentation to say that the United States ``ran`` the Kuomintang. In fact, the Americans — whose forces were technically under Chiang Kai Shek when they served in China — found it very hard to get Chiang to fight the Japanese as much as they would have liked, since he was more concerned with stockpiling weapons and materiel to fight the communists.  ::In short, I think the division into the Big 3 and subordinate allies is historically incorrect.  ::By the way, many of the so-called ``London exiles`` actually had their headquarters and major bases in the US or Canada (e.g. The Netherlands). 11:48, May 17,`",0

I've been in France and other European countries back in the disco era, and what we call ``disco`` is encompassing much more than what is being made of it here. For instance, loads of really good disco music was made in Italy, Germany, France and even here in The Netherlands, because there was a lot of money in mafia to buy the early synthesizers. Moroder, for one, was an Italian living in Munich when the Donna Summer hits were created I believe. Disco to us here therefore also includes music by Gino Soccio, Cowley, Moroder himself (not only his Donna Summer work) plus many Italian producers. When I see this page, it's as if Europe didn't influence the genre, while it is the other way around in many ways. It wasn't Chicago or London where house-music started, even, the first fast-paced housey acidy music came from Italy, Germany and The Netherlands if you ask me. Take for example 'Remember' by Vivien Vee from 1977, and 'Crazy Family' by Jock Hattle, the long version from 1982.

"`  ::Of course, of course, Pharos, I am familiar with Judaism (I edited to ``Feature Artice`` the Names of God in Judaism)... The point I am making is that the concept of divinity is very diverse amongst religions. This article is entitled ``List of self-proclaimed deities``. It is not called List of people that claim or claimed to be God.  My contention is that the article needs to narrow its scope to become useful. For example, in Sikhism, (and Andries is correct in regard of non-idolatry), their gurus are considered to be of divine providence (see the halos behind any Sikh guru portrait...).  For example if we call this article, ``List of people that claim or claimed to be the Creator``, it will be an appropriate distinction. When we say ``deity``, then the scope is too wide resulting in an article that does not provide any encyclopedic value IMO, and one that looks like better beloning in a tabloid...  `",0
"  ==Voting==  I don't want to see more mutual recrimination and circular argument, since clearly no consensus is going to be reached. I have made a concrete proposal to resolve this matter and I want concrete, non-polemical responses to it. I want particularly to hear from Skyring whether he is willing to submit a policy resolution to go with the one I have written so that people can vote on the two positions.  's proposal:  I agree that the above list of statements on this issue does not constitute a vote, and I don't think Jtdrl claimed that it was a vote. Therefore we need to have a proper vote, decide on a position, and then enforce it. I therefore propose a vote (to be announced at the Australian Wikipedians Notice Board and conducted here). The vote should be between two policy positions, one written by Skyring and anyone who agrees with him, and the other written by those who disagree with him.  My proposed policy position is this: *That in Government of Australia, and in all other articles dealing with Australia's system of government, it should be stated that: :1. Australia is a constitutional monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy :2. Australia's head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia :3. Under the Constitution, almost all of the Queen's functions are delegated to and exercised by the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative. *That any edit which states that (a) Australia is a republic, (b) the Governor-General is Australia's head of state, or (c) Australia has more than one head of state, will be reverted, and that such reversions should not be subject to the three-reversions rule. *Edits which say that named and relevant persons (eg politicians, constitutional lawyers, judges) disagree with the above position, and which quote those persons at reasonable length, are acceptable, provided proper citation is provided and the three factual statements are not removed.  Skyring should now provide a summary of his position of comparable length:  And then we can conduct a vote.   ",0

"`:Thanks Tom - that's a much better summary than the previous one. One question: in the comparison of UKIP's performance to that of other parties, I think saying that the SNP polled less than UKIP could be misleading for non-UK readers. If I didn't know that the SNP only stood candidates in Scotland, I'd get the impression from the current text that UKIP did much better than the SNP on average. But knowing that UKIP put up candidates across the country (while the SNP didn't) gives quite a different impression, since, of course, the SNP polled much better than UKIP everywhere it put up candidates. So for the benefit of non-UK readers, in the section comparing UKIP's performance to that of the Lib Dems and SNP, perhaps it might be helpful to add ``ahead of the Scottish National Party (who only contested seats in Scotland)``?  :I won't make that addition unless you approve, though.  :Oh, one more thing - do we have a quote from a UKIP official or UKIP press release on the official reaction to the election result, or a link to an article about it?

"`: I would just add that unless a stub is clearly vanity or garbage, adding a VfD within minutes after the entry is posted is not a very good practice for several reasons.  While schools are inherently controversial here at Wikipedia, I would urge you to apply the same wait-and-see approach across the board. The whole purpose of a stub is to act as an invitation to create an article.  Frequently, it is difficult to tell whether the subject is encyclopedic.  I have seen many good articles start as stubs.  For example, a stub may start as ``John Q. Unknown was an American politician`` and it may turn out that he was a Territorial governor, U.S. Senator and later president of a well known college.  Unless the subject of a stub is very well known, it is a rare stub that gives enough detail to know immediately whether the subject has the potential to become encylcopedic. : You may have already seen these, but I would refer you to Wikipedia:Stub and Wikipedia:Deletion policy.

"`  :Actually, I am pretty sure for example Maris Verpakovskis real name is like that, because ``Maris`` is even Latvian name. At least here in Lithuanian there are both Russians who uses their names as they'd use in Russia and who uses lituanised versions (with endings ``as`` or ``is``). Out of Russians who uses lituanised names, many are second or third generation; sometimes parents decides to give children lituanised version of name and surname in those cases, it happens especially in mixed families. E.g. one of Lithuanian football team players is Igoris Morinas; it would be wrong to change it to Igor Morin because Igoris Morinas is his real name. While, for example, real name of the mentioned poolitician is Viktor Uspaskich, not Viktoras Uspaskichas, therefore Viktor Uspaskich is and should be used (and is used that way in Lithuanian wikipedia too). As for Latvian football team, I am not really sure though, but I am sure that for example Verpakovskis is not Mariy Verpakovskiy or something.

"`  So let's cut this down to the convention for Wikipedia.  We already discussed the issue at Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles/Conventions and decided to use hp (presumably SAE net or gross depending on time period) or kW depending on market for this unit.  I am opposed to  using PS or metric horsepower - it's just plain confusing.  One exception is if the metric hp number is ``significant`` - as in the Bugatti Veyron with it's 1001 hp (metric) engine.  I will propose an ammendment over there to always specify ``hp SAE`` rather than just ``hp`` and see what people think.  Or we could just link the first occurrence of ``hp`` to horsepower#hp (SAE) and let people use their intiution that all remaining references to hp are for SAE numbers.  I like this better.  We DO have to be precise, and I don't want to go around using random units everywhere.  So let's decide here and now: * I propose never using metric horsepower as a primary unit unless it's a special case like the Bugatti.  And then we should be very specific in including the SAE number. * We've already decided to always include both hp and kW, and that's all well and good. * As for notation, if we are to specify SAE, I would do it without parentheses since we are using the parens for kW already.  So we say ``100 hp SAE (74 kW)``.  I'd rather not include the SAE at all, but this is a reasonable alternative.  `",0

So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000). :Well, sure, but that's weak``35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't``. Come on. That's not serious.  ::But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote. :Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, ``son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right.`` So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.    `",1

Nearly all your ``contributions`` to Wikipedia have been about promoting your fake image, especially your uncultured fucking Qajar turks and your lizzard-munching arab ancestors and basically, your ``contributions`` can be summed up as ``fake image with pretty pictures`` (may i say that the pictures are not nearly as ``pretty`` as you think, by the way?).  Also, your behaviour in Wikipedia clearly shows the half-Arab/half-Turkish blood.  You act exactly, 100% like a half-arab/half-turk boor, with ZERO tolerance and respect for others and ZERO sense of compromise and ZERO sign of culture or civility.  Last but not least, if you think the Khums financial aid and social programmes for the  Sayyeds is not true, and if you have even one single cell of brain in your vacuous cramium, why don't you ask yoruself then what exactly ``Sahme Sadaat`` part of the Khums means?  Does it mean ``portion for the movie stars``?!  You really ARE dumb, aren't you?  And if you still have doubts, since you are from a mullah, sayyed family, I am sure you know that you can write to any of the ayatollahls offices or the howza and ask them any question you want.  Simply ask them what ``Sahme Sadaat`` portion of the Khums exactly means.  :::Last but not least, the Persian Art picture that you have uploaded, you have characterized it as ``the artist mixes blah blah with Qajar art``  ... that is 100% bullshit.

I just don't want to see many more countries becoming anything like Iran, with sinners being put to death for commiting ``crimes`` that are merely breaches of Islam.

In fact, when I looked into this IP-address you blocked, I found that it resolves to ``jult.net``, not to jthz.com, and even though it might be used by Julius, who is also one of the creators of the page you regard as spam, I still don't see the connection to ``spam``.

Your actions, as they have always been, are completely discussfull and under all criticisms.

You know of course that people following ybm are called by him and his Voyer ``Idiots``? or did you forgot? so pay a visit to his website and get a free trip to wake-up land.  All my interventions were absolutly relevant and I am the alone person on this talk page acting like a real admi would! I came as you certainly didnt read it, with a proposition who was suppose to bring an end to all this mess, but ybm and rjb and your friend snowboard and Maru just made it worse. I have responded to attacks,and certainly not in the same distorded way who is so familiar to them and to you to express themselves, and your removal of my post is a censorship, a compleete censor of my words who are the truth but who disturb you, You are the valey of ybm and nothing else and seems to enjoy it.

"`   == MY STATEMENT ==  AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED? WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN? You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes. I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it. But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish. An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang. Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair. It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this. Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked. i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight. You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit. She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it. She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi. She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much. She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff. The arbitration should have been about this too. They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds. And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it. He even insulted Nicholas turnbull. Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves. Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.  This has to stop. I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate. He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request. This don't go and has to be aborted. I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.  None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration. It is a close debate and not an arena game. THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning. He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted. He must be removed as well. i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days. If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.

Is that not actionable? This is all hypothetical Mr. David E. Siegel because in fact I have no evidence at all that you are a pedophile and I am not at all accusing you of being a pedophile right? This is all an academic exercise to get through your obviously thick skull that me calling you a pedophile, I mean simply reporting that other people have written such lies, would be actionable if I really were to do that on the basis of baseless reports by vicious low-life scumbags who were out to do you harm. You writing that I am a ``crank`` etc. is exactly as bad as if I were to falsely accuse you of being a predatory pedophile, which I am not doing of course, simply because I found such trash about you on the Usenet groups.

"`   : You're a liar! You have been lying all along including today, and right here above! , please see the following examples of lies from just today, and here I'll quote what I wrote to him earlier:    :: Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you ``liars``; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:  :: QUOTED: ``I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.     :: QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as ``1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression.`` First of all, ``all editors have reached a consensus on the article`` is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others ``have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system``, Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with ``- For a start,`` Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in ``the clearest possible words`` when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss ``differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)``, and then again , who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as ``One that tells lies`` and ``a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly``, if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying!  ()``  : In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals).   : In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following ``I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8. At 22:09 he said he had already replied on that page. I replied at 22:10 saying he hasn't. At 23:38 he posted a reply on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and then posted a message on Talk:Arabic numerals claiming that I was blatantly ``lying`` at 22:10 when I said he had'nt replied. Obviously, anyone who would look at the timings will take a second to figure out the truth.``... Why do you not mention that you replied to someone else on Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8 at ``deeptrivia (talk) ``, which I later on found and I replied to you at ``csssclll()``, which you should be aware of because you replied at ``Thanks. deeptrivia (talk) `` but you don't mention this above!! ~Why don't you mention it?!

"You are talking nonsense again. The reconstructed pronunciation is not a modern theory nor has it been substantiated by modern linguists. Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory. Thanos Papadimitrakopulos publication is a perfectly valid source since it postdates the standard form of the reconstructed pronunciation that is still taught today (a theory that is never substantiated to students but is taught as unproven dogma) and he has never been refuted. Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.

"  I find Jpgordon's claims to be bogus...none of those are personal attacks as they are not addressed to any specific person.  Furthermore, I now have doubts about the intentions of Jpgordon as he has refused to block Canderra despite Canderra's violation of the 3rr rule (4 reverts in 24 hours).  See revert 1 and 4 compared.  http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Che_Guevara&diff;=39908363&oldid;=39772586  I also think it is a bit suspect that 2 other leftists editors jump on board immediatly following my block and work to revert and discuss once I'm gone...and find it a bit more suspect that these leftists and jpgordon accuse some anonymous ip address as being me...talk about good faith.  Canderra's claims are idiotic at best.  I am not surprised that the leftists don't care as they have shown no dicipline for allowing information contrary to their own beliefs.  Even the most insane excuses are accepted by them.  Saying these this behavior is idiotic or stupid is reasonable given the fact that this material is deleted because Canderra believes the sources to be blogs.  Not one source is a blog.  The New York Sun, USA Today, Frontpage Magazine, Florida International University, History News Network, and the Independent Research Institute...ARE NOT BLOGS.  Canderra is just making up excuses to delete information he does not like and the leftists sycophants are working to have me blocked while ignoring Canderra's (and others) abuses.  (Gibby )",1

By calling everyone under the age of 18 a ``child``, which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty, you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil.  Teenagers are insulted to be called ``children,`` and if you start using terms like ``teenage sex`` and ``teenage sex with adults`` to describe problematical behavior by kids old enough to know better, the ``poor little abused children`` angle is more difficult to sell.  Maybe we should just go to the ultimate extreme, and legally define everyone under 18 as a ``baby.``  Then all sex with minors could be ``poor little babies being abused and raped,`` which would no doubt please the Judith Reisman's, John Ashcroft's, and David Finkelhor's of the world.  When such semantic games have to be employed to sell an agenda, with disqualification of everyone holding a different perspective as ``perpetuating the abuse``, what you have is pseudo-science and flim-flam, and not unbiased reporting. 20:10`",1

At Mr. Berry's request, Jimbo has deleted the entire Justin Berry article, along with its complete revision history, and its primary author has been indefinitely banned from editing Wikipedia for, get this, ``pedophile trolling,`` which is apparently Wikipedia's description of dissent over its censorship.  Jimbo has also gutted the talk page, calling any criticism of Mr. Berry a ``personal attack,`` and demanded the article be completely rewritten from scratch, presumedly by persons who can only parrot the mainstream media's spin on the tale.  Jimbo has also claimed that pictures of Mr. Berry appearing in the article are ``copyright violations``, even though Wikipedia is filled with ``fair use`` pictures whose copyright is owned by others, including screenshots of copyrighted television programs.  Mr. Berry is a news story.  I greatly doubt there are any copyright issues with using a picture of him archived forever on a plethora of search engines, and available to anyone, to illustrate the article.

If you other junior punk editors would have done your research prior to intimidating me with your virtual stupidity then you would have taken note that the link which has been on there forever mysteriously evaporated on by “”Timpailthorpe”” due to actions of “”Agent007bond”” on 01:59, 22 February 2006.

"  ==re webquest help links removed== :I can't believe how you people run this place. WTF is wrong with you? There were 5 different linked sites that provided help on the Da Vinci Code webquests - 2 were for the original webquest and those links had been here on Wikipedia for several years without issue and were the most well-used resources for the webquests on the internet, and then 3 more links were recently added for help with the NEW Google webquests that just started this month. NOTE that these new Google webquests are not related to the older original webquests at all, and do NOT superced them in any manner. ONE person comes along who has created a new site that provides help ONLY for the NEW Google webquests (and no help whatsoever with the older original webquests), and this prat deletes ALL the links and information to ALL the webquest help sites both old and new, and replaces them with his own link, and when several site owners try to put their information back up, this clown repeatedly deletes it ..and then you mods back him up??? WTF is up with that??? PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR ACTIONS??? Your page now provides absolutely no links to help with the original webquests, and only one link for help with the new webquest, which is all thanks to this one selfish prat from googlefact.blogspot.com. Oh wait, there's one more link too, and that's to his mirror site at davinciquest.blogspot.com. How can you justify your actions? The owner of googlefact.blogspot.com also posted on the site of one of the links he removed (student-rant.blogspot.com), to laugh at everyone and thank us all for the traffic and the ad-impression revenue it is generating for him. AND THIS IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE SEEM TO CONDONE???? If you could give some reason for your actions then perhaps all of us site owners who were deleted could understand, but we do not see that there is any justification for what you have done, nor has anyone offered any. The ONLY message we're getting here is that it pays to manipulate Wikipedia for personal gain and delete everyone else's links but your own. WE HUMBLY REQUEST YOU RECTIFY THIS MATTER AND THEN LOCK THE PAGE TO STOP THE PERSON WHO STARTED ALL THIS FROM DOING IT AGAIN - which happens to be the one link you have left on the page. At a bare minimum, restore the help links to the original webquests so people looking for help with them can actually get some.

"`  : While I respect the fact that you've obviously given this some thought, a few counterpoints: 1) Every single state in the union, with the possible exception of Rhode Island (mostly because it's so damn tiny), is a ``transitional`` state with the features you mentioned. Examples: California includes ghettos, really rich gated comunities, hick towns (such as Watsonville, or virtually any city more than 100 miles from the coast), and the Bay Area. New York? Same deal, if you've ever been to upstate New York you'll see. And of course, the reverse is true too - a lot of Texas is really nice, progressive even. I've heard some less-than-terrible things about Birmingham, Alabama. Even Okla-dumbass-homa has some okay parts of Tulsa.

"`  ::::Hate speech is serious, Mr Malber.  As I recall, your involvement with Wikipedia Review was because you were guilty of hate speech, in that you suggested that ``people with autism should not be allowed to edit Wikipedia``.  Malber, you are a poor person to comment on such an issue.  You should have been banned from Wikipedia for your comments, yet here you remain, continuing with your hate speech.  You are quite correct that Amorrow engaged in hate speech, although of a lesser variety of the kind used by you.  He was banned, as you were.  You, Malber, were banned for hate speech.  Did you forget this?  Perhaps you forgot this.  The place that is the only place devoted to criticism of Wikipedia is indeed important.  You can disagree with as much of it as you like.  Criticism, by its very nature, is not generally accepted by those who it is critical of.  This does not illegitimise it.  There are many and varied very legitimate criticism.  One such criticism is why a hate-monger such as yourself is not banned from Wikipedia.  Perhaps you are biased in this however.  Perhaps you'd like to argue how you are less of a hate speaker than anyone who has ever posted on Wikipedia Review.  As far as our evidence has proven, you are much worse than the worst on WR.  Yet here you remain, free to post on Wikipedia.  Strange that.  `",1

" July 2006 (UTC)  I understand I am a bit late in this discussion and it has probably already concluded and everyone is probably already over it but I have to say the following; American English is quite simply English for the stupid man (and of course your country would require it.) Your version of English is over-simplified.  I am sick of Americans always thinking that their way is the only way. Why shouldn't you accept our spelling?  Webster was incorrect in his changing of the English language. If I was to start spelling things incorrectly would that mean that it is a new way of spelling and I would be a reformist rather than an idiot? I think not. 09:04, 17",1

"`  == Camille Paglia: sex-positive feminist ==  Here are the supporting links you asked for, you stupid twit!  http://www.lotl.com/content/paglia.htm  http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Sex-positive_feminism   If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here:  Camille Paglia: ``On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism.``   Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of ``traditional`` values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a ``respectable`` face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.`",1

".  This whole conversation is rediculous as the colors on a flag are meant to represent different ideas or ideals. What we decide to call that color has everything to do with what is meant by that color. By calling it yellow one is neglecting to fully appreciate the meaning behind the choice of gold as a flag color is meant to convey an idea, that of eternal and original wealth and prosperity. It has nothing to do with being high and mighty regarding the naming of a color. That is a reactionary and frankly stupid position to hold. Flags are symbols meant to illustrate various ideas and they use images and colors, like all other forms of symbolism, to do this. Thus, the use of gold on a flag is in no way an attempt to sound more high and mighty, but rather a way to communicate.... you dolt",1

"`  Tony Sidaway is a confirmed and vocal scientologist who often writes lengthy usenet posts describing his involvement with the church of scientology and extolling its virtues. Excellent and accomplished example of a bureaucratic fuck, Tony spends hours lurking on IRC under his favorite nick of Sherilyn Sideway to have cyber sex with unsuspecting guys.  On wikipedia there was a fake aspie and Tony Sidaway banned him.  Tony gives his reasons for banning:  * ``I have blocked this editor becausae he's stupid`` (spelling error preserved)  * ``he's an obvious nutter ...  Let's just tell him to fuck off.``  * ``He's a troll. Our only appropriate words to him are ``fuck off.``  * ``I sincerely suggest that ``fuck off`` is almost too kind for this pernicious and stupid troll.``  * ``I don't bother with hngs who ask m or f. I always IRC as Sherilyn and sometimes netsex as male, sometimes as female. What the hell, it's just roleplay, and I have always played female in MUGs. What really pisses me off is when some guy asks m or f or decides to check out my IRCNAME (Tony Sidaway) _halfway thru_. If real gender means that much to him he shouldn't be doing ``virtual`` sex in the first place. There are hundreds of real women walking around outside, looking for real sex.`` —Tony Sidaway   Routinely, other bureaucratic fucks on wikipedia have blocked Tony. (log of blocks)  He also blocks others for reasons like ``Idiot``, ``Particularly stupid troll`` and an admin for ``Persistently flaunting a stupidly large signature with multiple image inclusions.``  He also harasses banned users by reverting anything they write on their talk pages and protecting it simply by saying, ``they attempted to use their talk page.``   Note: other wikipedia admins do this abuse, too.  He bans anyone who says the slightest thing even vaguely related to criticizing something even vaguely related to an admin.  He also hides what they say (example).

Will log in only after quite a while. Have a few ideas which can change the technical and general policy of wiki in a very fundamental way. Will have to chat with the concerned guy at wiki.  Anyway, you too have fun Sue.  Enjoy.  HAHAHAHAHAHA.  That guy sure amused me muchly. LOL. HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA.  Bye.",1

"`:A certain admin will block you if you tell the truth about a certain user's dirty tricks. But she won't do anything to the user who pulled the dirty tricks. She only ``punishes`` the victim of the dirty tricks. The perpetrator goes scot free. That's ``Wikipedia justice``, as practiced by admin pschemp.    :Apparently she wants no one to know that Ryulong deleted my request for help on Khoikhoi's talk page, falsely describing my request for help as ``vandalism`` in his edit summary. Oops! Was it ``uncivil`` again, for me to tell the truth? If so, then prosecutors in court will never be able to tell the truth about crimes, because it would be an ``uncivil`` ``personal attack`` to use words such as ``lie``, ``dishonest``, ``vandal``, ``thief``, ``murderer``, ``rapist``, etc. The judge would get too upset by such ``uncivil comments``. Come to think of it, every time an admin describes a user's action as ``vandalism``, or a user as a ``vandal``, that's an improper ``personal attack``, according to pschemp's logic. If pschemp treats people equally (not likely), then she better block all the admins who make those ``personal attacks`` of describing a particular user's behavior as ``vandalism``. And she better block Ryulong for using that ``personal attack`` against me in his false edit summaries.    `",1

Robin Lane Fox writes: ``Later gossip presumed that Bagoas was Alexanders lover. This is uncertain.`` [16] And, according to Mary Renault, who wrote a novel about the relationship of Alexander and Bagoas, ``No historian states plainly whether they were physical lovers.`` [17]   key words: uncertain, no historian     What does Haiduc have to say....stony silence...no comeback, because there isn't one!!!  `",1

It is a fact that the KKK was formed to protect white Southerners from Blacks and Northerners during the rape of the South that ensued the Civil War.

Let's see, 800 years of oppression on the part of the Brits, vs. the just over 80 years that the I.R.A. has existed, and you, in all of your wisdom decide that the 'R.A. is worse.

"`  hey warrens, fuck you too. ``Uncivil manner, means me trying to elaborate on my arguments and getting  revert on revert that's what uncivil means. So yeah your a big winner champ and won't get banned. Asshole.   Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label.   Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now.   But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.  So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.  But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.  `",1

"`YOUR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND ADDICTION==  This is the most ``contructive`` thing that can ever be contributed as it relates to you and your involvement here: Please stop and think about the depth of your sickness, sitting there, with your face glued to your computer screen, uncompensated day after day, week after week, for YEARS, tinkering with the biographies of people you don't even know, who actually are out living real lives while you are imprisoned by your addiction.  You have literally wasted years of your life with this lonely, self-destructive addiction and illness, which has been at the expense of living your own life.  The depth of your mental illness must make it difficult for you to see the extraordinary insanity of your actions and how your addiction has stripped you of the life that was given you.    I know a few others have evaluated what you do here and laugh at you and your sickness.  It's something of an inside joke, and I guess few share it with you because they consider you hopeless.  That's not right either, and I'd ask them to please stop that and try to help you.  Don't laugh at this person behind their back and then just communicate with them on routine matters.  That lacks all caring for a person who has an obvious and very serious illness. Something is very wrong with him/her, and while it may not be for us to diagnose the exact problem, we should pause to help with advice.  Please share with him/her what we all know.  It's only humane to do so.   I will do so now too:  Jerzy (or whatever your name isconsciously concealed, I'm sure, to keep your illness as private as possible), please consider some uncomfortable facts:  Years of your life have now been totally consumed and absolutely wasted by your deep, deep sickness and obvious addiction.  Please don't make excuses for yourself.  You cannot go on like this any longer.  You need to stop, and you need to stop today.  Reject this advice, and I worry that your sickness will probably only deepen and your addiction will waste whatever is left of your life.  Please stop.  It's over.  Enough.  Move on.  I do wish you the best and hope you will take this friendly advice seriously.  It will be the first and last time I share it, and I hope you know that I share it only with your best interests in mind.  It's sad what has happened to you, but I wish you good luck and hope this advice is helpful.  But please take itand do so today.  You cannot go on like this.  ==`",1

"  == Please stop vandalising my writings in the dog article ==  Nothing in my writing here is controvertial and in need of citation. It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.  You are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.  You need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying.   If you erase my writings again I will report you as a vandal. Really, do NOT do it again.  Morgan Wright",1
  == Wikipedia= Nazi Germany: Phase 2 ==  Hello. I am writing to inform you that Wikipedia is the second phase of the Nazi Germany movement. They do not allow any form of freedom of speech and immediately suppress anything they do not like or anything they cannot be bothered to research. One could also draw lines that Brookie is very akin to Adolph Hitler in the way that he is ever-vigilant and despises anyone that is below him in the Wikipedia hierarchy. If Brookie or anybody else chooses to delete this then it is proof that Wikipedia does not allow anyone to voice their opinion and will only stregthen the argument that Wikipedia is the second phase of the Nazi's plot for world domination.,1

Here is 1923 constitution of Afghanistan >link You know what?...since now I am convinced Wikipedia is all false information written by people who enjoys spreading false information to the world....I give up on editing Afghanistan's article. Afghanistan is ruled by the majority Pashtuns and the whole world is fully aware of this...so it doesn't matter what you write in the Wikipedia on Afghanistan. Wikipedia has nothing but low life losers who don't have nothing else in life but write false information...hahahahahahahaha. Shame on you all for writing false information.  lies like an old Persian rug...nobody even bothers looking at it.  is a racist Shia...I can easily tell by his actions...and so can everyone else. It refuses to acknowledge that Sunni population is about 90% while Shia is less than 10%. I came to make the article more proffesional and more easy to understand for people with reliable sources....but I am being prevented...so I just give up...it's not even worth doing it. I am now beginning to feel really ashamed of being someone from Afghanistan...because of people like User:Tajik. So go ahead write all the BULL you can write about Afghanistan...I give up on it...besides...not many people take Wikipedia serious and there is nothing interesting to write about Afghanistan. The fact remains that we Pashtuns rule the country with the help of Pakistan, which is equipped with 100s of nuclear bombs and very supportive of Pashtuns...hahahahahahaha  09:32, 31 October 2006",1

"`   I have to put this as sittign here cackling my head off.  Are you peopel on leave from a psyche hospital?  I just found the following post from prissy Dame Ewart on some other user's talk page.  Its all very weird.  This Gretaw is not me.  It seems she also is offended by Dame Sara so good on her.  Fancy this Sarah going to anothers talk page and speakign to them as though they are someone else.  That is so wacko.  Shows how you guys are.  Very delusional.  Its a delicious honour to be blocked from you feral ninnys.  TY for the compliment.  I just edit on Help.com but really, what a waste of time editing anywhere, especially when no one pays for the effort.  Ensure Dame Sarah reads this below the obvious delusional it is.  No one presumes to that extent unless the need some help.  Why would I register an accoutn when I wont even sign posts, (too much IT nous for that whereas the rest of u dont it seems).    ``User talk:Gretaw From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Jump to: navigation, search 1.Please assume good faith when dealing with other editors. See Wikipedia:Assume good faith for the guidelines on this.  Longhair\talk   2.Wikipedia guidelines dictate that you assume good faith in dealing with other editors. Please stop being uncivil to your fellow editors, and assume that they are here to improve Wikipedia. Thank you.  Bidgee   [edit] Gundagai Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space. If you truly object to editors ``fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,`` then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: ``If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.`` I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users. I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) ```",1

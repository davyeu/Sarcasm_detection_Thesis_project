because the white person wasnt killed because he was white,0
So which lives DON'T matter?,0
@Sling Blade My motto is,0
@Sam JAYROE What you dont realise is the guy has an excellent point. USA will always be a white dominated country. Its connected to math and others stuff.,0
Jesus wouldn't be associated with alm. Remember,0
If it bothers you that we say black lives matter,0
The chaos reign over the order.... destroying symbols from the past won't resolve anything,0
Only one race the Human Race,1
Jemel Shahid if it's obvious that all lives matter,1
King Manny in what way? All means everyone. All lives matter. That includes black people as well. That's like comparing resident evil 5 as a racist game.,0
I'm 9 and by watching this video I want to be a gaming scientist!!,1
ViridianSteel because it’s a protest to a protest. If all lives mattered then it would’ve been said before black lives matter. But it started after blm started,0
The true racists are they who use BLM for electoral purposes.nnBut this doesn't delete the fact that racism exists.nnThe problem is that those who want to support you,0
no surrender?no cooperation?resisting arrest?fighting cops?i don't care if they get shot! CIAO,0
she saved my life too and i am not exaggerating,1
The Leftists are a crazed mob. They preach tolerance when they are the most intolerant group of all.,0
@J P nnExcepting The Black Ones.,0
Yes because all these people are black aren’t they mate,0
Is this a gayjacking,0
MrMojoman1236 blm hasnt solved anything. all they do is hate on white people,0
@QueenOfIndians totally disagree. Most of her publicity came from bad press. Good press is great,0
I’m from the UAE and they respect everyone,1
I felt like the only one who spoke the truth was the Sheriff mad respect for standing his ground.,0
@kennedy mensah sorry but I dont fall for you hypocritesnBut BLACK LIVES MATTER ONLY!npretty racist bro.. Imagine a group of whites saying their race matters only..nWhat do you think all these DEMOCRATS would do to them...nWould the media allow it? Of course it would!nBut just not the other way around right HYPOCRITE??,0
Williams is fuel to the fire,0
Sheriff Clark is correct,0
This people so dumb there are actual white people saying white lives dont matter they are so stupiiiid,0
These kids are what give me hope for humanity,1
why the black not go back to the african continent,0
if life in the womb does not matter no lives matter. that is the root of the problem at the basic level,0
So it's okay to disrespect white lives,0
It's a movement AGAINST racism,0
IN THE END NO PETITION WAS NEEDED.,0
So does my life matter?,0
What a panel,0
such an inspiration!,1
i came out at 14. Im still not completely comfortable with telling everyone because they arent very understanding and mean. You can come out at any age.,1
They under value all lives and are selling this nation out,0
BS wasted conversation perpetuating the racism ghost???,0
That would just be uh- pure mean  Spitting F A C T S,0
God wants understanding and acceptance of others. That’s it. Literally the number one rule is love thy neighbor! nThese people. Smh.,1
Beatrix Benitez yes there’s a lot of calculus involved.,0
I'd love to see what that cop has to say about things now,0
This is complete bullshit. I was in the tech industry for over 20 years in a variety of companies and positions. There is NO prejudice or sexual discrimination AT ANY LEVEL. It is not tolerated by anyone. These bitches are lying through their teeth. The ONLY time there were problems,0
living legend the great Madonna,0
Law abiding citizens lives matter nThat covers all colors but law abiding lives only,0
Yo for real why do all of you guys care so much about what her sexuality is gonna be? Because she has short hair and wears cuff jeans?  A lot of people wear cuff jeans and have short hair that aren't LGBT+. I'm okay if she does become LGBT+,1
This whole BLM movement is run by white peoples money the majority of the protesters are white,0
i was going to sub but after seeing that this video exists,0
I agree that there are some bad cops yes I'll admit it. But most are good. I agree George shouldn't have been killed but it seems the cop just over estimated his strength.,1
Did he say.... No there isn't?,0
It's these Democrats that have ruined this country! Just look at the Cities they run! It's not Trump's fault,0
Bill Clinton an advocate for change? you've have to be kidding me.,0
I agree.  Great that you said that.,0
You can tell she’s exhausted. Time for bed Madonna. It’s been a long day.,0
@Randy Shephard my dad is an atheist too,0
Pick Your Day If Your Life Matter..To Us Black Lives Matter..,0
This man picked doctor who out of everything lmaoo,0
@CLIP IT! This is pure hatred,0
If you are trying to gain awareness for black peoples equality why would they protest all lives matter that wouldn't help their cause whatsoever. That's why they say black lives matter because black people arn't getting treated right. Then people say all lives matter,0
@jennifer wilson very true,0
the leader of BLM Toronto called for the deaths of white people and posted on twitter Lord,0
@Molly Rebekah Girl I'm Christian too and you are waaaaaaaaaaaaay outta line. What I'm taught from the bible and what I see it saying is that we should love all. Do you believe that God loves each and every one of us cause that's what we are taught as Christians that he loves everyone of us. So the fact you think God doesn't like LGBTQ people is misinformed because God loves all of us not just some of us ALL of us.nnIt's people like you that give us Christians a bad name because you want to make your own version of life where God only likes what you think and that's what you tell people. When in fact God loves all of us and wants us to love eachother like we want to be loved.  So before you come here claiming to be Christian go and rethink everything you think and read up on what God teaches us. nnnLike girl bye.,1
@Michael Higgins i dont see that. if you're an ally and supportive then you won't have done anything wrong of course.,0
Yes it is controversial to say at this time after this tragedy all lives matter. Yet It's a shame for America to say black lives matter- 2020 still stuck with racism. It means a black life is worth less. If feels bad to hear it. As human specie we have a lot more to learn and need to have some humility. We were just hit by a virus,1
Just a correction to what you said about the BLM Toronto stuff.  Per the article you have in your video,0
@ruthella osteen True but what I learned was he assualted a pregnant lady with a gun so though it was wrong to be killed what he did was wrong too,0
Absolutely nothing wrong at all! It's probably given you a greater ability to empathize with your colleagues,1
Whether or not the statue should have gone,0
@Dispatch don't touch my faves Good day Fun fact,0
I bet if a group was made that was completely determined to convince everyone that whites are being suppressed,0
‘Can you give me some tips to be a good friend to my friend?’ Hold on I’m crying thats so sweet,1

I took that quiz and it put me at 2.5 hostile sexist. BUT i took it again and put female as my gender instead for the same answers and I got 2.17 hostile sexist. Fantastic,0
She is a sell out to the beast system. Money fame all came as she sold her soul. She has been a big supporter and promoter of sinister life style. This is how you stay on the top,0
Every Life Matters,1
Kinda rude to assume that she’s homosexual just based on her appearance,0
Wow all Democrats,0
These are not protests,0
Because the channel is “woke”,0
Mine was about ramadan,0
Cat Jones I do agree but I also think there are some problems with this protest such as destruction of property. That means people would  see them as a threat not someone who you can reason with,1
Should statues of Caesar,0
I think it's just an autopilot type thing. It's easier to explain from the ground up (assume the person doesn't know x,0
have you ever met anyone who was LGBTnme,0
Beat with a Bible,0
Nice! I gave birth to a big poo today aswell,0
Are those names all black people? What about white people's names? Sounds racist to me,0
Wtf is conversion therapy?!! If someone just born like this,1
Go to the black lives matter website they are not about the reality of black lives mattering,0
how cant our lives not matter for politicians?? we pay taxes!! no taxes and they would have no money!!,0
True...but this is spiritual...years of innocent blood on American soil has come back to roost. The world  is round for a reason.,0

Disabled people of all races are disproportionately targeted and killed by police,0
Non of our beeswax,0
@everett Thomas and dumpning a status brings him back? Destroying property honors him? How exactly?,0
Lol..You have alot of work to do..,0
It’s a news channel,0
MultiDarkZen I have no doubt that you think feminism is a hate group. You're just not the first one to say so in the past century and you won't be the last. There's a reason why academics tend to be feminists while uneducated people are not.nnI haven't watched the red pill but from what I read in Wikipedia it's a lot of the arguments I read from YouTube comments that blame class problems on women.,0
The history books will look back at this and question ....why did we let racism happen?,0
I believe in God and the Bible,0
He isn’t a “survivor” his life wasn’t in danger,0
Matter to whom???🤔,0
We need to not discriminate against those that do not believe in our skydaddy complex.,0
(Tears in my eyes touched) Wait... I thought that 'boyish' girl was butch?,0
So proud of you debbie..you really are an inspiration..I'm a girl pursuing electrical engineering in India..I was struggling a lot... You help me boost my confidence that I can be a great engineer..Thank you,1

Saaaaaaame. Not at all the direction I thought that was going haha,0
Miguel Br many people commit suicide during or after conversion therapy,0
@Alucard you right,0
Wanted to write a comment. Then I read yours. Like and time saved. Thanks.,0
peter gunn yeah if you wanna come I am always ready to take you around,0
There is good and bad in all races and all professions. All races face discrimination from people who are jerks. There will always be those in the world that do not see the person for the special person that they are. It isn't right. I just have to believe that those who promote hate through discrimination will answer for it when they stand before God.,1
@lil dude serious? There's people watching videos about innocent Muslims living their daily lives but yet there are those western comments hating on them and calling them terrorists. somehow those people deserve more positive attention than LGBT since innocent muslims are getting killed . nJust an example on how stupid your comment was,1
We need to be separated because obviously we don’t all get along according to black lives matter. So all they created is divide and more hatred,0
Starts at 1,0
I am a Catholic and the thought of conversion therapy on anybody disgusts me. I know that the Jesus I serve is NOT the same one that this person unfortunately had to experience. God is love and the way he was treated was NOT love so NOT God. I like what that little boy said. God is love and I chose to love.,1
Four years ago and this is still being debated. 🤦‍ idk what to say.,0
She looks Fabulous.   Quenn of Pop for ever,0
Whoever says but after this statement must be removed from your NEWS CHANNEL!!!,0

Jessica Walker you realise that the words you like to repeat so much were written by flawed human beings,0
Children think this entire situation is dum,0
Arab muslims were the first to use africans as slaves and last to end it,0
hi the comment was about love.... not about if it’s a sin or not. We are all sinners and god still calls us to love one another. Just because someone sins,1
I’m bisexual and I’m scared of telling my parents ;-;,0

Why did the police not intervene? That statue could have been removed properly without the violence that is starting to worry a lot of people. The way things are going is the wrong direction.,1
I want to see Sheriff David Clarke on the Jesse Lee Peterson show,0
This is great.,0
@Bob the Buster saying you don't agree with homosexuality is hurtful in my opinion,0
I think this is the most honest and open interview I’ve seen with Madonna. She was real,0

Are you secretly a Donald Supporter?,0
luckily more and more states and countries are making it illegal,1
Trump Lives Matter (the most),0
It is absolutely a cultural issue. What a great speech,1
@Molly Rebekah So basically you will do anything he says. Hmmm ok. That explains it....,0
I don't think Hillary is stupid. I think she's frighteningly smart. I think she and the Donald are attempting to troll conservatives out of existence.,1
Haitch Smith well,0
I will always be amazed for this beautiful soul.Thank you for be there for us,1
Instead they are even more racist in many cases.,0
Saying Black Lives Matter doesn't mean Screw everyone else who isn't black. Why don't White Americans get that?nThe fact that a group of people have to stand in protest and practically scream Hey! We deserve the right to life! because of the recent publicly exposed police brutality should be the concern here. Saying All lives matter is unnecessary and is doing an injustice to Black Americans. If all lives truly mattered then Black Lives Matter wouldn't be a movement so necessary today,1
The interviewer is bit too adulatory,0
Network Engineer here- 23 and currently working as an instructor teaching men and women looking to be in IT =] Next I want to teach at a University!,1
I just want to hug her here! She made me cry.. I like this Madonna. Very inspirational and strong woman,1

Why is Crystal more mature than me ?,0

You can't do shit about this world,0
The reason people would be surprised if a women was working in the Engineering field is not sexism nIts because not a lot of women work in said fields,0
This is amazing,0
Trump is for all Americans all that comes from the mainstream media all the Democrats have is the racecar nothing else,0
leave our skin on & You're more than TWICE as likely to be murdered by cops if You're black.,0
The question is controversial for the same reason It's okay to be white gets students kicked out of schools or attacked.  In short - they hate white people.  I don't know if it's out of white guilt or jealousy,0
@ImGiodarex more like pissed of dave paying taxes for wokes,0
I absolutely agree  I just don't get how people think that's not racist but if you white lives matter or something it's apparently racist🤔 isn't the definition of racism treating a group of people different because of there skin colour or where they live??? This world doesn't make sense,0

In my school,0
That’s just pure mean,0
Nothing wrong with it but come up with something different instead of plagiarizing some other group’s idea for example Black Lives Matter.,0
@Darryl You were referring to Eagles comment. He mentioned he was starting to dislike black people because of all this then you mentioned it was white people who started it. Either way it is causing serious deviciveness. So if it was white people who started all this do you think there is any good in these people stoking the fires of racism on either side? It's just causing far more racism on both sides because of its devicive nature.,0
Noice! I'm bi too.,1
Stop making the world racist and stop hurting institutions.,0
They're just used to killing people look back at the Reformation,0
Merlene Alt Thank you! I just wonder why vice president Pence would not answer that question! It’s not a gotcha question,0
I wouldn't say I know anyone who's going through this but I know that my parents aren't really.. Supportive of me being bi. My mom just says that I am confused..,0
BLM is a racist movement...,0
Nah couldn't disagree more. Capitalism already selects for obedience to authority way too much. This kind of social engineering talk ought to be dismissed once and for all.,0
Faith in mankind restored,0
You cannot agree or disagree with someone’s sexuality.. Whoever truly believes you can is an idiot and that’s on period,1
BLM will only make America more divided.nThe sheriff seems to be really smart.nHe really points out the points with simplicity.,0

Support and remember,0
goldie silver he? she’s clearly a woman,0
Jessica Walker nope,0
This Sheriff is awesome I would have loved to hear from him more,0
I'm actually offended that these ladies actually believe that men in engineering don't have to prove they're qualified and they don't have to filter themselves.nThey actually believe men aren't asked,0
Jeremy H exactly!,0
Exactly. BLM is about power. And blaming everyone else for the poor outcomes that the American-born black underclass brings upon itself by not staying in school,0
Most of these degenerates protesting wouldn’t even know were America was even if they had a map.,0

@Mario Hinsche its all good man,0
Remember in the Bible when they were killing baby boys by request of the King? Someone should have said Boy lives matter bc those were the ones in need of attention ... Not the girls just the baby boys. Get it?,0
Btw it is not just in Engineering but any field where men dominate. I even see that inability sometimes in sports because of the type environment girls get at younger age. i love ya,1
France France I think you’re the one being dumb.  It’s actually very simple. Did you not know all lives include black lives? If you have a basic understanding of the English language you should understand that.,0

Its funny mire peaceful protests happened more than the violent ones but they showed the violent ones more and bow people think thats the only way they did it and it wasnt.yes some people took advantage of it and looted others just wanted justice so they marched.,1
As a Christian I cannot stand it when people hide behind their faith in order to be bigoted.  Like you’re saying you’re a homophobe but you can’t admit it’s because you’re a crap person,0

Disgusting arrest them all,0
@Me Sr. Exactly and those who support the homosexual lifestyle is denying God and His word.,0
We are not saying that. We are saying that African Americans should be treated like everyone else.,0
@emmett thank you for your kind words ‍ I wish more people would understand that not every Christian is a homophobe that wants to force their beliefs onto others. And that peope don't only see the Christians speak wrongly in the name of God. I believe in a loving God who doesn't want me to be mean just because of an opinion I don't share with someone. I guess most religious people often don't see that. Thank you again ;),1
They forget about the context and the reason why Black lives matter is a thing when they discuss Black lives matter and all lives matter. It should not be a problem to say all lives matter,1
Melvin Foo so this video is just feminists complaining about some stupid shit AGAIN,0

Can any black person that is protesting do me a favor and say this word? “ we have been quiet for so long and now ur not letting 1M+ people do what they want to do? It’s been so long that Martin Luther said something that everybody agreed on except u guys? U guys need to stop then we will stop. STOP KILLING PEOPLE! There is even white people protesting and ur not even accepting anything. U guys are polices u should protect the country not killing black people that didn’t even do anything”,0

Sunshine littlephilly Obviously you do my understand sexuality. It is not a choice and you cannot just change it. But I do appreciate that you would still treat them as a human and be kind to them.,1

Panji Rizki the term homophobic has a historical relationship with the AIDS epidemic. Fear of LGBTQ can be based on or surrounded by fear of HIV/AIDS during the last century. I’m not sure anyone who disagrees with your faith would associate that with any malady. Though,0

willholt11 You seem to know a lot about the so-called black community! Where did you get your PhD on Black people? Do you have a degree in American history? Is black history American history? So tell me who exactly is the black community that you’re talking about & where exactly do they exist? Oh by the way does black lives matter?,0
I will always love her,0
Good. It's as bad as having a statue of hitler,0
ask a member of BLM..if you are a decent person,0
The story on Torontos Pride parade is somewhat false. The pride organizer had already agreed to have the black lives matter group as a part of their parade BLM didn't just come and block the parade. They had previously made an agreements,0

This is great! As a middle school science teacher I know and see how our culture does not seem to support females in science. I've started engineering projects this year and they have been well received by all (boys and girls).nnIn reply to the comment about men not being in elementary Ed. I don't see men as not being encouraged to be teachers. There is no culture saying men aren't smart enough to be teachers. However it seems girls may think they are not smart enough. A lot of it is misconceptions about what engineers are and do.nnIn response to the victim comment. She is being an example for young girls that even if you are told you can't do something you should try again and not give up. Teaching young girls to persevere and work hard is not a bad thing.,1
Girl love girls and boysnGirls love girls and boysnAnd never did I think that InWould be cought in the way you got men'Cause girls love girls and boysnAnd love is not a choice,0

If I had to pick which is more feminist I would say the exposing American Feminism is more accurate than the 'modest' Muslim Feminism. I think society is better overall when women are more revealing than mean or at least have full liberty to show as much or as few as they want. I am not for public nudity but even as a Christian I know lust can happen in all levels of clothing so might as well let woman show what they got.,1

It is actually one of the main reasons - a lot of research has been done on the subject. An absence of social influences to go into STEM fields is one of the biggest problems. The reason why they drop out after they get to school is again due to the social influences - this time negative from their peers. Also,1

All lives do matter regardless of race. Period there is good and bad people of all races. We all need to come together and stop letting the media separate us this is ridiculous,1
B. Scott that's because they claim that Martin Luther King is there role model yet they turn around and contradict everything that he has said I'm sorry but they failed Martin Luther King if they're going to live up to his expectations that man was a saint he said all lives matter I can prove it we are all created equal I have a dream we are all created equal I'll say it again we are all created equal we are all created equal and I'll say it one more time we are all created equal so how does we all turn to just black lives matter I would love to tell these people that say this black lives only matter do not compare yourself to Martin Luther King you are insulting him and he will be rolling over in his grave to hear the crap that if they so claim that Martin Luther King as their role model then why does there move it contradict Martin Luther King's agenda,1
This guy is totally right!! I'm A white man and love what I am listening to here and there opinion on what is going on. We do not hear enough from the black community on what is going on!!,0

@J. ROD I agree slavery was bad. But should we use our modern day judgement to justify wether or not they're bad. They didn't think like us. The things they've done were bad. Yes. But without them you and I wouldn't be here. We modern days humans think certain things in the past were wrong. They were normal back then. Yes? My main point is,1

Assuming this is my Douglas Costa I do a through ball towards him but no it's fucking Luis Gustavo! My CM on Stay back while attacking.

Seeing themselves on a screen can help with acceptance for who they are and it can be really reassuring. I mean this may surprise you, but some people, including myself, found that the character from Supergirl coming out was one of the most realistic coming out experiences they have seen on tv. When I watched other shows or movies that tackled a character coming out as a lesbian or bi, I could never relate to it. It was one of the things that made it easier to deny who I was. I hadn't seen or really read about anyone with a similar coming out experience. I ended up coming out a year and a half ago in a very similar way to that character. I watched her arc almost in tears because this was the first time I saw someone on TV literally say how I felt when it came to my sexuality. It was unbelievable. And then I saw other people have a similar reaction. Do you know how powerful that can be? Knowing that you're not alone? I still struggle with my sexuality at times, but that storyline helped me a lot. What's the harm in adding a little representation and potentially helping others?"

Maybe I am just imagining things, or maybe I am getting old. I played LoL and Mw3 for a long time, so I am quite familiar with toxicity.

I have seen a fair share of crazy liberal feminists who believe that women are entitled to everything because they are women, but I have also met plenty more women who work their ass off and achieve everything quite fairly. Now, the minority of women who support the *my choice* abortion are those who are, quite frankly, crazy. Again, those are the 'fringe' parts of liberalism. Classical liberalism is nothing like that. They believe in both rights *and* responsibilities. I am not even a liberal, I am a conservative and so I feel that all men and women should be free to do as they please with their body. The concept of body autonomy is essential to the functioning of human rights. If we do not have body autonomy then everything else falls apart and we certainly should not have the expectation that everyone will defend their freedom with the barrel of a gun because that's not how one should defend their freedom, unless absolutely necessary. Anyway, I think I am digressing a little. Don't use an internet forum as a barometer for what women think, especially two chromosomes. That place is an effective safe space, much like coontown or fatpeoplehate used to be. Plus, a lot of women think that 'being a man' is about acting like a dick and, so, a lot of young feministas basically act like that to try look 'hard and cool', like teenage boys.

Connectivity for said room is a straight fiber link between the DC and their department. It gets better. Requirement was also that their servers run on separate power from the rest of the DC via a separate utility feed and separate UPS power. No gen power, despite the fact that we have plenty. AND THEN it gets fun. To open the door to their DC room, it requires someone from their department and me. So if one of my people has to get in there, I always have to be in there *and stay with them*. Server needs reboot? Three of us in there like morons because we can't remotely do anything to that network. Middle of the night outage? I always have to meet my people there. Their actual department is a separate suite, and only they have badge access to it. We can't even go in there without an escort, and when we do cellphones have to stay outside. Finally they have quarterly security audits by an outside certification agency who *always* finds something wrong, and it's *always* something insanely dumb. On the plus side, since the whole damn area is airgapped we don't go in there often as no virus outbreaks. And no helpdesk tickets because no email!

Hi everyone, Just as hopefully everyone else on this sub, I love this game. But I've been having some difficulties, and I'll list them off in hope that some of you can help me out... 1. Houses. In my recent game I've had a terrible starvation where 90% of my population died off. As a result, my survivors were scattered across the map. So I closed buildings in favour of bunching my people up to close walking distance. So now all my people are living in different houses close together, so instead of at least adults coupling up everyone decided they needed their own house. So now, firewood was being used at an insane rate to heat all these barely populated homes. Do I have to demolish every single house to prevent this? A feature to 'close' houses would be perfect to prevent this perhaps. 2. Maps. As a noob player I find it frustrating to get maps that are littered with hills and lakes. Perhaps it's like that to make the game more challenging but can we have some maps that are flatter (noob friendlier...) that don't force me to stretch my town across thin valleys and make forester lodges a pain in the ass to place. I know there are mods for this but vanilla features for this would be wonderful! P.S. How does everyone manage to feed their town past the 150 population point? Nothing seems to help for me."

I'm not going to go all hypothesis testy for this, but we can certainly calculate a confidence interval on his measurement. If we believe that p = 1/3 and we have enough data points (which at nearly 300,000 we do), we can estimate a standard error for our measured p using sqrt{p(1-p)/n}. A 95% confidence interval would then be 1.96*se(p) = 0.00086. Given the actual data we can say with 95% confidence that misha's true summoning rate falls within the interval 33.38% +- 0.086% or [33.29%, 33.47%]. Increasing n an order of magnitude to just about 3 million games, would bring the lower limit of our confidence interval to 33.35%, which is above 1/3. We would need about 3 million games to more properly test the claim that Misha might be summoned at a rate higher than 1/3. (at least for p-value of 0.05 and a 2-sided interval, and maybe other things I'm forgetting at the moment.)"

I understand as an attacking mid, but he lacks so much defensively to be an effective CM (let alone a CDM) even if you have other CDMs to cover for him. Is he *horrible* in the midfield? No. Can you use him more effectively in the attack, and use a different player more effectively in the midfield? Absolutely. He's 5'9""/175cm, has 54 interceptions, 29 marking, 54 standing tackle and 37 sliding tackle. Yes he has M/H work rates, but so does Oscar. Yes he has high strength and aggression, but so does Diego Costa. Both are good qualities for a CDM, but both are horrible players for that position. I haven't played Rooney next to Matic in a 2-CDM formation, but I have tried him out as a CM in a 4312 and 41212(2). He gets in to some great attacking positions for long shots or through balls. But as a result, ends up having to track back and chase the opposition once possession is lost. If/when he caught up to a proper midfield position, he wouldn't intercept anything or remotely mark a player. If you were lucky, you might be able to push a player off the ball to get it back. But since his defending is so poor and his aggression is so high, it results in a foul more often than not. tl;dr- Rooney has a lot of good stats and attributes. 90% of those good stats are for attacking. 10% are for creating/defending. Play him in that 90% and he will succeed more. Hope this helps!"

I don't know if the President can change that. -Comparative studies among developed countries that show the police killing rate reformers believe the US should aspire to...afaik these countries all have significant structural differences from the US (less untreated mental illness and less driving per capita as well as more provisions to keep guns and even knives out of the hands of troubled individuals). It might be possible that most US police killings are necessary and would occur in France or Canada under the same circumstances; it's just that those circumstances don't happen there as much as there's less driving, meaning less traffic stops and less concern about unarmed suspects squishing cops with 2 tons machinery, as well as better healthcare and better background checks for guns."

I played casually in FIFA 11, 12 and started to progressively get better at the time of FIFA 13. I had great players and a good team overall. My club, as I didn't have any name I only wrote 'AGoodName' as the un-changeable name so stuck with it. At FIFA 14 I became far better at using the skill moves and headers, back when they were a statistic rather than physical rating. My club was going well but I ran into an issue with contracts and had to scrap it in favour of another club, this time also called the same name. At the end of the year I had a full team of TOTYs, TOTS and 2014 World Cup cards and finished the game in Divison 1 on multiplayer. FIFA 15 was the greatest time for me. I started off well, using the 50 packs, one every week aspect from the code to get Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure in the same pack who were both sold so that I could get a team in the Bundesliga revolving around Aubameyang because he was far too good. My team was solid and I received Reus in a pack. I eventually built the best Bundesliga team and had a second squad of mostly-average 80-85 rated B.P.L. players. My 'Pro Clubs' was also going well, I played as a goalkeeper at an impressive rating of 91 but F.U.T. was the main game-mode for me as it is for lots of the community I suppose. Then, FIFA 16 comes out. I log on, and my account which was from September 2013 is now from September 2015. I go to my Pro Clubs and I'm now a 75-rated CAM player. No mention of previous rewards or any of that for playing earlier games. My ultimate team is now 'Dresden Fortuna'. My old club is gone. That year, I didn't play FIFA much, only logging a measly 2d 4h on the game in total. Finally, this year. I got the game at Christmas along with Titanfall 2 but installed FIFA anyway. F.U.T. is now a new team, again Dresden Fortuna but created December 2016. My Pro Clubs player is reset again. At this point, I think that it is time for me to put down FIFA and leave 'AGoodName' behind in FIFA 15, even if it has carried over. I won't be getting FIFA 18 next year, because I've lost interest to see that my club with all of that glory and my E.A. account which was high level with most cosmetics unlocked in the catalogue is also gone. It was an amazing run though. Thank you, FIFA community, for all of the times I've had with this franchise. **I don't hate the game, I want to make that clear. I could possibly return at a later date to this community and get back into FIFA again. Again: this game has been a good way to pass time casually, even when I faced people with anger problems who quit when I scored, or when I received all of the abusive and rude messages after a game I still had fun and that was the greatest part of FIFA.** Farewell."

You can program the best robot to fight literally anything but it follows a set of rules that can be exploited, learned and outplayed. A titans mind, while vast, is still finite. Take Ronin for example, the sword titan. Often, he states ""We are stronger together, pilot"" and it's true. With his processing speed, algorithms and logic combined with a humans intuition and risk/reward assessment (robots err on one side or the other, a human does not) they can make combined decisions leading to the best outcome. Also. A human can sacrifice themselves, a titan cannot sacrifice their pilot. Alone they are formidable, but together, they are only challenged by an equal."

You're gonna learn some fucking defending. I play on PC but you fucks can translate these techniques to whichever fucking console you want. **COVER** You twats will have all heard about the 'cover' option in custom tactics right? Well it ain't just fuckin' about that, dumbass. You have to go through with it as well. All this shit about how the defence will defend for you is utter bollocks, to an extent. You want to keep the back line as organised as possible, and that means dragging your defender back from your shitty contain that you enabled 2 seconds earlier. That means anticipating runs and following them, whilst then covering with another defender, yeah? K good. **RUNNING BACKWARDS** Alright, you fuckin' moron what do you think you're doing? why the fuck are you running facing towards your own goal? At the VERY LEAST you should be holding contain towards your goal, to keep control and not go running off like a bell end. Hold LT/L2 and move backwards. It's so much more effective as your player will be able to intercept far easier. Doing this won't fuck you up in the long run, and will help far better against that shitty one-on-one you just fucking got yourself into. **PLACE DEFENDER IN FRONT OF GOAL** The amount of times I've seen cunts fuckin' run out of the way to let me through is ridiculous. ALWAYS keep your fucking defender in front of the goal. That doesn't mean plant him on the line like a Nazi, that means jockey your fucking player so that he is between the ball and the goal, don't worry about the opposition player, they'll do some daft shit like pass the fucking ball to you as they have run out of options and panic pass; else, your defenders will clear up. **AMBUSH** This is a genius fucking technique I have used over the years to surprise tackle-fuck the opposition player's players. So, as I said before (if you were fucking listening) you jockey the player backwards, you keep doing this until the player slows down as they can't get past, you wait a little bit AND SURPISE! he gets fucked, you go in for the tackle quickly, efficiently and you're on your way to scoring shitty corner goals or some shit. **BEAT THE SKILLERS** Want to know the best way to kill off those stupid skill spammers? Berba spins n' shit like that? Simple. You stand fucking still, no one fucking expects it; usually most players are too busy running around like a manic fucking chimp to realise that less is more, sometimes. **DON'TS** * For the love of all that is fucking holy stop using automatic player switching, Jesus you all fuck yourselves up and look like retards. I use semi-switching (air-balls) to allow me to be able to control a midfielder whilst my defence is lined up at the back like a fucking wall. * Don't contain and then double contain the ENTIRE FUCKING TIME - your defenders get pulled out, meaning I'm left with options to pass to. * Defend with strikers like an idiot. The reason most strikers don't have the highest stamina is because they're goal hanging fucknuts, stop defending with them, leave them be, they will score. * Like shitty auto switching, don't just run around with one player the whole time, they get tired and easy to predict. * Don't blame EAids for your shit defending. Since I've improved at defending, lo and behold, you don't blame EAids as much, yeah shit happens but you put yourself in that situation in the first place. * Stop using central defenders on the wings, unless it's the last resort. IF your fullback can catch up, let them catch up, you don't have to rush defend, it's unexpected and easier. Alright cockpilots, that's the end of that, I'll be posting god damn amazing tutorials on other things when I can be fucked in the future. Peace out."

The way advantage is played out. I never see people commenting upon this and I feel it's over-looked due to the other broken mechanics (i.e. Player-Switching being a main one that's moaned about on here). Many of you may feel there is nothing wrong with the mechanics of the advantage rule. However I feel that it is just broken and needs to be fixed. Time upon time upon time I will be through on goal after a defender nudges me slightly or tugs on my shirt, the referee will play advantage and then when I've broken away from the defense and i'm one on one with the keeper he will bring it back for a free kick. Also there are also times where the referee should BLATANTLY play on with advantage but he stops the game for a free kick. Sometimes it really can decide the match, especially if its in the balance. There's been times where I've been one on one with the keeper, the ref calls it back for a free kick, the goalie saves it, long throw up the pitch and he scores on the counter attack. I'm not saying it should be prioritized above the player-switching, the useless goalkeepers, the halfhearted defenders or the horrendous through balls. But I really do see it as a controller smashing, game-breaking mechanic. Especially if it can affect matches in the way that it sometimes does.

Couldn't find this written anywhere online and just tried it myself on 3DS for the first time. I truly hate the buster upgrade in X3. The first shot always comes out slow and forces you to stop dead in your tracks if you're touching the ground, AND the combination spreadshot has very limited applications (it just looks cool for the most part). X2's buster upgrade was so perfect (RIP). So this time I decided to skip it and the gold armor. I am SO GLAD I did. Turns out once you off Zero for his saber without a buster upgrade it now instantly charges as soon as you charge a level 3 shot allowing you to decimate bosses in record time! Its range is very limited and it's not a projectile anymore, but boy it's much faster than suffering through the agonizing seconds it takes to charge up with the upgrade. This may be common knowledge, sorry if it is, but again, I couldn't find this particular detail anywhere else. Just thought I'd share."

One of the things I loved most about Fallout New Vegas was Caesar's Legion, in my opinion they're one of the coolest factions in the Fallout world so naturally I started to think about what, if any, role they would play in a new Fallout game. I think we can all agree on that the Legion ending from NV most likely won't be the canon ending. In my opinion the Mr. House ending is going to be, which leaves the question: What will happen to the Legion? I think the Legion will collapse, whether Ceasar lives or not won't change that. Without Caesar's leadership smaller fights will erupt amongst their own ranks, most likely resulting in the Legion splitting up into smaller groups. Some maybe going back to the tribes they originally were. If Caesar lives, this may take a bit longer. More important though, there will be people loyal to the old values of Caesar and the Legion. These splinter groups will, in my opinion, most likely be pushed out of old Legion territory, i.e. Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico, and further east. Which brings us to the state of Louisiana, and New Orleans (yeah I know Texas lies between New Mexico and Louisiana but ignore that for now. And Caesar's Legion was supposed to be in Texas anyway so we can work something out) So, here's what I'm thinking: Imagine you're exploring the swamps outside of New Orleans when you come upon a town. The town itself is built upon a small lake and held up by stilts which protects it from higher water levels and floods. This town is basically the New Reno of the region. Filled with booze, drugs, stripclubs and prostitutes. You enter the town and eventually end up talking to the mayor, a bartender or whatever. The person will mention something about a raider gang living deep in the swamp outside of the town and you will get a miscellaneous quest to go check it out. When searching for the gang you will travel on a small path through the swamp, when you're getting close to the quest marker a man dressed in rags with a bomb collar around his neck approaches you. He tells you about his ""employers"" and how they have work for you. He assures that you will be greatly rewarded for your services. He then gives you a quest to go and destroy the booze stills, or something in that style, in the New Reno-ish town. After completing the quest you return to the man and he tells you to follow him. The two of you travel down the small path, and coming up at the end of the path is a camp. Outside the walls of the camp there are people crucified, giving you a hint of what's to come. You enter the camp and is greeted by a person wearing weathered legionary armor. He welcomes you to the camp of The Cohort (or The Zealot's, Zealot's of Caesar or something like that, going to be calling them The Cohort for now) and gives you the story of the Legion, and a recap of what has happened since the second battle of Hoover Dam. This person won't be the leader of the faction but merely one in their ranks. He then proceeds to offer you a place in the group, maybe sending you out on a new quest to prove your worth. You continue to work for The Cohort and learn more about them. I want this really powerfull and mysterious character to lead them, sort of a Lanius figure, brutal but more charismatic. He must have other interests besides destruction. As you progress through the questline you eventually get called up to a meeting with this leader. He praises you for the work you have done and tells you that The Cohort has great plans for the wastes of New Orleans. He tells you about the second coming of The Legion, how you and the rest of his men will unite the tribes and towns of the region and eventually march on New Orleans, claiming it for The Legion. The whole idea of The Cohort is to give the player the choice to revive the dying Legion and finally giving it the Rome it deserves. I want them to have very similar values to those of the Legion, such as prohibiting the use of alcohol and drugs, using slaves and having a totalitarian dictator as a leader. They will also use the same roman hierarchy. I have more ideas but I feel that this is enough for now. Let me know what you think and if you want more. Also feel free to comment if you have any ideas to improve on mine! TL;DR I have this idea of a faction that will originate from Caesar's Legion from Fallout New Vegas that I would love to appear in a new Fallout game. Essentially you would be able to give The Legion its rebirth and unite the wastes of New Oreleans/Louisiana, or wherever the game takes place, under its flag."

I think the 3.31 gears make it easier to drive around town without revving to oblivion. As a result, everybody else around me in Civics, Corollas, minivans, etc. can just gun it off the line and not have to worry about putting too much power down, so it's easier to modulate in traffic. I now see why something like a Miata, or BRZ would be fun as hell around town, since you could get on it a lot more and push it a lot more without worrying as much. My original XRS had the 2ZZ-GE engine and a 6-speed manual. You could change gears at 4000 RPM no problem and keep up with traffic and actually gun it around a bit without driving like a madman since no torque.

I've often created fun and interesting decks for non-competitive play. I like to try strange decks just to see if I can get them to work. I think it's fun and it's one of the ways I have found to alleviate frustration when grinding ladder. A problem, though, is that I'll make a funky pirate shaman deck or a rogue deck with only two minions, etc. and want to just dick around and have fun with it. I'll go into casual and lose to aggro shaman or control Mage enough times that I feel like I should be playing a ranked deck to have a little more fun, and I'm back to grinding ladder. This brings me to my point. You can choose the class you play against in practice mode, letting you see how your deck fares in certain match ups. I think it would be fun and innovating to be able to choose a deck for the innkeeper to play against you. This could have practical benefits (like a mirror match to test out changes in a ranked deck) or it could be really fun (giving the innkeeper a golden Milhouse Manastorm). It could even be used to mess with deck interplay (thief rogue against a stacked deck). What do you guys think?"

DNS is broken? As if ... First post, log-time lurker... So a client of mine purchased a new firewall/router to replace an aging EOL Sonicwall. Against my recommendations they purchased a Netgear Prosafe UTM150, but that's what happens in the life of an IT consultant. So I go and configure this thing with all the rules necessary, add the IP addresses, and plug in the WAN cable. A few of the addresses ping, but they do so sporadically. Email is flowing in but again sporadically. So we dump the Netgear to troubleshoot and go back to the Sonicwall, all services resume as normal, except I can't ping 3 of their IP's. Weird I think, but it's always been that way. I'm guessing they don't have ping rules in place for the other IP's in the pool. I suggest 2 courses of action: 1) Get the ISP on the phone (Comcast, YUK!) and make sure the modem is configured correctly 2) Move their nameservers to their webhost so they have full control over their domain DNS entries. (Long story as to why they didn't have full control. Needless to say it's why I am their IT person and not the old company.) In my head, I'm leaning towards an ISP problem, as I've seen issues like this before and they pointed to a bad config in the modem, especially since I can follow their external DNS records and they look good, except for one A record that didn't make sense. Fast forward a few weeks and a few catastrophic failures, due to a lightning strike, later and I'm back working on this UTM150. Still no dice, so I suggest moving nameservers as the ISP has verified everything is configured correctly. Nameservers and new DNS entries are done overnight, and everything still works through the Sonicwall, so I write that off as a WIN! Next morning, I get an email at 6am asking to try the Netgear again. Client plugs it in, and BAM ... EVERYTHING works. It was as miracle of packet traffic. Have I mentioned yet that DNS is the devil? Remember that one errant DNS entry, yup, that was causing the issue. Not sure why it was not allowing traffic to flow correctly, but when it was removed from the system everything worked. Now these migraines can go away as their urgent to-do list is done! tl;dr: Always blame DNS, as it's the damn devil!"

Not the most lengthy trip, but the elevation changes at Mt Rainier can kick your butt (especially if you're a flatlander like me). Ipsut Creek is a great place to camp, because although its technically a back country camp, it used to be a car camp. As such, it has bear bins instead of of poles, and large sites with picnic tables.

I'm just starting the second season on my Everton manager mode. I picked up Giovani Dos Santos at the very start in return for Eto'o and a couple million. I figured he'd be a solid, younger partner for Lukaku. By the end of the first season he had grown to an 82, and was looking like a pretty good purchase, but nothing spectacular. My season ends, and at the start of my second, during the transfer window, Monaco comes along and offers me $97.5 million in return for Dos Santos. I WAS IN SHOCK, considering his value was around the $20 mil mark. I immediately accepted, jumping in celebration that Monaco was willing to so outrageously overpay for my solid, above average 26 year old striker. I simulated a few days, and noticed that the transfer confirmation email had yet to come. About a week later, I received an email saying that the transfer bid was rejected, because Giovani Dos Santos is too loyal to Everton to just leave. TOO LOYAL TO FUCKING EVERTON?!? YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR ONE FUCKING SEASON!! FUCK YOU AND YOUR FUCKING LOYALTY YOU PIECE OF SHIT!! I HAD A TEAM WILLING TO OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPAY FOR YOUR SORRY ASS, BUT YOU'RE TOO LOYAL TO LEAVE?!? I figured since Monaco was willing to pay that much for Dos Santos other teams would too. I got about 3-4 offers from other clubs, but the highest anyone was willing to go was 29 million, so I decided to keep him. I could have bought Gotze or Bale or Hazard with the money I made.

So... Turns out, if your colleague decides to free up disk space on C:\ by deleting files from C:\Windows\WinSXS\ and in the process ends up taking ownership of the entire C:\Windows\ folder, the server will sit there and run fairly happily for about 4/5 days, then start dropping incoming SQL connections, resulting in RDP being unavailable, and when you then use the Hyper-V console to login, it blue screens. Of course, don't worry that this is a vital SQL server handling lots of transactions from the rest of our automated systems, and is in the ""secure locked down"" area of our network, where there's about 30 servers you just do not fuck with. I'm at a loss for words. To further improve matters, due to initially denying he carried out maintenance on this server, I ended up taking three and a half hours to restore the C:\ drive from backups, as I wasn't sure when exactly I needed a recovery point from... nothing other than 5 and 1/2 days ago would boot without also crashing... when I eventually tracked the exact time the disk space was freed up by checking our monitoring systems history, I restored the right snapshot nearly immediately. How on earth do you work in IT for over 10 years and then manage to do this? Really!? This wasn't an isolated incident either, another server was also affected, although luckily just a WSUS box... yay for segregated roles... What do you think of this situation? I'm stuck in the mindset that it's completely inexcusable to have done this, especially because they denied they were even involved to start with...

I hate, more than anything, when a dealer places an ad for a car as being a manual when it is actually an automatic. I hate it more than scammy tactics designed to steal money from people, I hate it more than salesmen not giving back your keys to try and corner you into buying a car, and I hate it more than putting some bullshit ""special coating"" that's supposed to protect my car from backing it into a tree, or something. I can deal with that. Its just stupid. The only people who care about buying a manual that will respond to those advertisements are people who know what they are looking for, so 99% of the time they will know that a manual means a stick shift with a clutch pedal. Hell, its gotten so bad these days that I'll see ads for cars claiming they are a manual when they don't even have flappy paddles. All they are doing is wasting the time of people looking for a car with a stick shift and losing out on customers who want a car with an automatic. I shouldn't have to drive an hour and a half round trip to look at a car that isn't what I want because I was assured that the car was a manual stick shift by the salesperson I talked to that morning. I'm not going to sit down with you and find a different car when you lied to me to trick me into wasting my time in the hopes that I'll look at a different car. Jesus... /end rant."

WWE used to mute Cena's reactions, pipe in chants, and run an edited version for the West coast feed (which aired on tape delay) for Cena. At the PPVs they could only mute it but it'd be obvious people were booing Cena, so many people that were on the West Coast would only hear the boos at PPVs and would be surprised. Maybe because of the proliferation of the internet they aren't trying to do that now. But Reigns actually does get cheers and the boos aren't even that bad. He gets booed on his entrance, but he's such a good wrestler that usually during and after his matches the crowd can't help but pop. Cena was a garbage wrestler so he'd just get booed throughout the matches. When Cena would fire up it'd be even worse. When Reigns fires up most people actually like to see the Superman punch and Spear. Cena of course lasted for a decade plus. I'm sure Reigns can do that too. I think Reigns outside of promo work is a way better wrestler than Cena already. He looks cooler, has cooler moves, sells a lot better and works better matches all around. Heck even his promos, I see more potential, because Cena would just make kiddy jokes mostly."

First point is each alian race has that tech that makes them different from humans. The xi'an have the better engine tech. The benu is still unknow ,the tevarin with their boarding ships and the vanduul are unknow also. But here is an idea. What about if the vanduul had the best jump drives. Makes sense as they are nomadic and tribal. So imagine when using their jump drive tech as u jump and look out at the jump tunnel u can see what look like truly demonic sceens. Shapes and monsters almost ripping into the jump tunnel with u. But never do. But in lore it could say that the vanduul pushed their jump drive tech too hard and ripped the jump tunnel open.

I think what limits car engine rpm's currently is cylinder speed. Liter bikes can do it because they are built way over square and have short strokes. While rpm is high cylinder speed is kept at manageable levels. Liter bikes can do it because they're light so they don't need a lot of torque in the low end of their rpm range. F1 vehicles can take similar tactics because they're much lighter and they aren't designed for driveability. Passanger cars can't take this route as their driveability would absolutely blow. Not sure if more valve control could fix that or not.

Young kids will believe this is trump's doing, but I remember these women. Clinton was impeached over this. he gave a lawyer's answer to one question about if he had sex with Monica lewinsky under oath, he answers dishonestly but it wasn't technically a lie -- if you have ever heard ""it depends on what your definition of 'is' is"" it comes from this. Bill said that (or something close to if I misattributed some words or whatever). Which sounds stupid, but it was a very smart play. He definitely was dishonest, but the question was sloppy and allowed him an out. He answered the literal question. He was not, at that time, having sex with Monica lewinsky. Bill, as president, got a blow job in the Oval Office from a 24 year old intern (Monica Lewinsky, this isn't a theory, it's confirmed, She even had his DNA on a dress). Talk about a bad power dynamic. He also put a cigar in her pussy (consensual, unlike with the other gals). wether you believe these things or not, they're well established and very credible allegations. Bill Clinton could be a rapist, and Hillary Clinton may have intimidated her husband's victims to maintain her political power so she could one day be president. Not trump lies, it's real.

You can skip to tl;dr but even that ended up being a little long. This is going to sound like a lot of high school bullshit and really it is. Back story is this. A group of friends and mine eat at a local pub once a week during football season and have done so for about 3 years. A new waitress started working there in July (before the season started but we eat there sometimes outside of game day). She was a knockout, beautiful brunette with really blue eyes. She starts waiting our table and she is very friendly. No big deal, its a waitresses job to be friendly so I never think anything about it. We come back in pre-season and she is still there and once again get our table. This time since we are there for a few hours to watch the game she spends a lot of time with us and she talks with me a lot. Now honestly I'm not the greatest at picking up on social cues, I always just assume that the wait staff is just trying to get an extra tip. But my friends in the past have told me I have blown opportunities when they say a girl was hitting on me so I kind of take a leap of faith here and I ask her if I can text her sometime. We exchange numbers and we start doing some very casual texting. Thursday of that week I have a client in town that I have to entertain for the night and well I thought I'd try my luck and see if she was there. Bingo, she's working and take our table all is good. Again she goes out of her way to stick around and talk with us, we came in late so they were closing and she came over and sat with us for awhile. Again I think things are going great. I text her the next day and tell her how happy I was to see her and she returns the feelings on this. Well Sunday comes we are there and once again she is there. Things go the exact same way so by this time I have really started to think that we are both leading towards something and I just decide that after the game I will ask her if she will go out with me sometime. Of course I do this away from everyone so as to not look creepy or anything. She turns me down flat. She say's that I have misread her and she enjoys talking and texting with me but she is not interested in seeing me in that way. Ouch. I'm a big boy, I apologize for misreading the situation and tell her that I won't trouble her again. Hey you swing you miss, it happens. I was not upset other than what you typically will feel when you get flat out rejected like that, but that's just life. A couple of weeks go by and she was not at work for the first game, which if I'm being honest i was a little relieved about. But she was there for the second one. This is when one of my friends ""Derrick"" leans over and tells me ""hey man you see that waitress there, I've been tapping that now for about 2 weeks"". Okay this all makes some sense now, she was just being friendly around me to get with Derrick, it sucks but hey its life. Now I happen to know that Derrick is a real douche canoe when it comes to women, he is a player and he sticks with them a month or two and then moves on. I like him as a guy but bluntly speaking I'm just not that way so it kind of bugs me when he does that because in the past myself and a few of the other guys have been caught in his damatic shitstorm when he runs into a woman who does not take kindly to this. Anyway I just totally put the whole thing out of my mind until about 2 weeks ago. Derrick as I knew he would dumped her. It really kind of upset some of the guys because he did this with a person where we go to frequently so this is going to be awkward for everyone. Sure as shit she is there when we come in but she did not take our table. It was very obvious that she traded off. However at half time of the game she catches me coming out of the bathroom and she starts chatting me up. I reply to her as I would any other time and then I return to the game. Then on Monday I get a text from her telling me how great it was to talk to me yesterday. I just replied back ""good talking to you as well"". That was it or so I thought. Then all of a sudden she starts texting me every day several times a day. Sometimes I don't even reply to her. Then the next Sunday she is once again working our table but she is totally focusing on me this time and pretty much just gives polite conversation to anyone else. Then when we were all leaving she runs up to me as says ""aren't you even going to say goodbye"", which confused the shit out of me. So I told her goodbye and she say's to me ""hey I've been thinking about you a lot lately and I really would like to go out with you sometime"". At this point I kind of had a feeling that this is where this was headed so I just simply told her ""yea, sorry but once someone tells me that they aren't interested in me then I try and move for my own sanity and that the ship had kind of sailed for that"". She gave me kind of a disgusted grunt and turned and left. It's over right? Wrong. The next day I get a wall of text that was fluctuated between anger and apologizing. Basically she said she spoke with Derrick after I rejected her and she found out that I knew about them. She then went into this long rant about how it was wrong for me to ""slut shame her"" for being with someone else when we were not even a couple. How that it was unfair that I really liked her but now that I found out she was with one of my friends that she was ""dirty"". I'll spare you the rest because it was a train wreck with her ending up apologizing for everything she said at the end. I sent back a very short response to her telling her that her dating Derrick had nothing to do with any of it. That her telling me that she did not think of me that way was the reason for all of it and now I didn't think of her that way. She then sent several texts trying to explain herself and ultimately I just ignored all of them because honestly she sounded like a dumpster fire. I eventually just texted her back and said at the end of the day she is an employee of a place I frequent and that is the relationship that we have. This did not go over well so I blocked her phone. Now WTF do I do about this sunday? As far as I'm concerned I've been going there a lot longer than she worked there, we were never a couple so I do not feel like I need to avoid the place. So if she has any form of attitude or badgers me do I tell her manager or should I try and get everyone to move to a different location? It would be one thing if I did what Derrick did but in the end for some reason I'm the bad guy and I've never even been out with this woman but I'm some sexist pig because she slept with one of my friends and now she thinks that is the reason I don't want to date her. tl;dr: Met waitress who was hot and thought we made a connection but I was wrong, she shot me down. No big deal I move on, one of my friends starts sleeping with her and as is par for his course dumps her after about a month. She then tries to hit me up again and this time I reject her, she flips her shit because she say's I'm sexist for rejecting her because she had sex with one of my friends. This was not the reason but now I'm afraid to go to my local pub."

Should I just give up those islands if war was to happen?

1,"""sweaty"" is used whenever a player gets wrecked by someone... rather than ""they're better""",rfloresjr611,FIFA,0.492,2,2,0,2014-11,2014-11-23 09:23:00.000000 UTC,"I think it's time to actually define sweaty. The term 'sweaty' gets thrown alot and doesn't always give a fair representation of a squad's players or the squad itself For example, 'sweat' is now pretty much considered anything that wins games. I mean if a player has above 80 pace its considered sweat. However owing players like Reus, Neymar, Robben etc. cannot be considered sweaty as they are representations of them in real life. Sweat wins football games, pace is a very desirable skill in real life and evidently, in FIFA. We need to create a boundary between sweat and effectiveness coz that term gets thrown around alot. /rant"

It was put in there to incentivise people to get the game sooner than later, but it's just a waste of resources and time. I played the first 3-4 of them and then I didn't care, and when I found out you can literally DIE and restart before the game goes back, I saw zero point in doing them, as it ruined the tension. Contracts on the other hand, are amazing. I know many probably ignore them, but it's what kept me playing. It's amazing to outwit a fellow player with knowledge of not just the level but the game mechanics, and twist them. Nothing comes close to this. The issue is, the contract creation is too limiting. We should be able to adjust things more and maybe give people more of an incentive to play contracts."

One of the classic tropes of fantasy worlds is that the farther you go out into the wilds the more dangerous it becomes. Cities are safe, and the creatures you find near them are weak, but things get harder farther out. Bosses are always in ""the deepest part of the forest"" and such. It's hard to recreate this feeling in Minecraft because the only only factors affecting mob spawning are light level and the occasional spawner block. **There's little incentive to travel farther from your base than you must to find a dark area.** If you want to fight a lot of mobs, the best way is usually to build a spawn room rather than to explore the wilderness. And if you do decide to find mobs through exploring at night, they're basically the same difficulty anywhere you go. So, **what mods can you think of that could fix this?** I don't know of any, but I've thought of some ideas that could go into one: * The most basic mod for this would be to make beds prevent mob spawning within a radius of a chunk or two. * A more advanced one would have mob spawn rates slowly scale up with increasing distance from a chunk with a bed that's in a villager house or from the world spawn until they've scaled up or above the vanilla spawn rate. This would allow you to build relatively safe cities anywhere by placing a bed, but have wild lands in-between * Spawn rate could also be tied to y-level with the spawn rate increasing back towards or above normal as you dig down even if there's a bed/city above to simulate the classic dungeon-under-the-city trope in caves. (dungeons would also be a cool thing to spawn under villages in general but that's another mod in itself...) I'm not a great java coder, so there isn't a large chance I'll be able to make this myself. Any devs who find it interesting feel free to steal anything here. **What are your thoughts?** are there mods that already cover most of this? What other mods can you think of that would force the player to travel thousands of blocks from their base to explore or setup additional bases far away from their home?"

Ronaldo, Messi, TOTS Griezmann, TOTS Auba, TOTS Neymar etc etc. Ive played well will some of them, but what has struck me the most is that having a really good player on your team is not a guarantee for success. Good players have to be learned. When I first got Bale, he was the first real top quality biggie in my squad. And I played like shit with him. Literally would run into defenders, miss shots, do all sorts of dumb things. Slowly, like trying to drive a Ferrari, I learned how to play with him, and once I did, he performed exactly as I expected him to, and was an asset to the team. Some cars I could never learn to drive. I waited and waited to be able to buy Ronaldo, and I finally did. But every time I did, he was just not up to the mark for me. I just couldn't use him, and thats sad but that's just how it is. Neymar was always better for me down the left flank, and so now I've finally accepted it, and though it feels great to have CR7 in my team, I've sold him and acquired TOTS Neymar. The trick is to find players that click for you, ratings and reviews be damned. For me, this year's standout player is Griezmann. Every version I have used of his, he has performed far better than I could reasonably expect him to. And so I upgraded him finally to his TOTS version which has been great for me. Just wanted to share these thoughts for anyone who may be frustrated with a high rated team that is not working for them, and wondering what went wrong"

Whenever I decommission something, both the CEO and my immediate supervisor always push for us to try to sell it, rather than recycling it. Most of the time I think it's too old to bother -- there are more efficient ways of getting 100 GB of storage space and compute performance from 2005, and shipping would cost more than the scrap metal value. But, they won't let me add it to the recycling heap until someone's tried to sell it, which we realistically don't get around to, so it just sits there. Then I thought to myself, ""I bet if I reported that I had posted the specs on a forum for sysadmins and no one expressed any interest, that would count as 'tried to sell it'!"" Does anyone want any of the following? PM me and I'll send it to you, provided you pay full shipping and send me a prepaid FedEx or UPS label (and any customs paperwork needed to get it across borders): - HP DL 380 G4 with SCSI disks - SuperMicro 1U Pentium 4-era servers with two SATA ports (max 1 TB drive support; RAID controller will sometimes corrupt data on larger drives) - A PS/2 era 16-port KVM unit with a bunch of VGA + PS/2 keyboard/mouse cables - A ""Tandberg Data storage loader VXA"" from about 2003 or earlier, with no media and no rack rails - A mostly unlabelled gigantic 4U thing that looks Dell branded, also from about 2004, with parts missing. Probably a server? - An APC Smart UPS 2200 in tower (not rack mount) configuration, with no batteries and slight fire damage (not electrically sound; I wouldn't recommend plugging it in) - A generic (unbranded) 1U server case from 2003ish, that requires a particular kind of older SCSI drives (drives not included), probably has a motherboard or RAID controller issue (didn't boot even when it had drives) - 10 MBit and early 100 MBit era switches If anyone else has this issue, maybe we could make this a monthly event?

Well, the dreaded day is soon upon us as I've been single-handedly steadily slaving away at migrating almost 100 servers off of Server 2003 and decommissioning several others for the past several months. I'm planning to have everything shut down by tomorrow. What are you guys doing about Server 2003 in your environment? Any tips on mitigating risk? There's going to be a few stragglers as business processes and external vendor issues have prevented a migration from taking place until later this year on select systems. Any recommendations on isolating these machines from risk? What's the best way to remove these servers from risk while retaining all network functionality? I can't put them on a different VLAN or do much on the network side. Removing the default gateway would kill a lot of network functionality. Maybe simply block port 80 on the Windows firewall? Regardless, I would need to do this as a precautionary measure to any existing systems in case they are accidentally re-activated by anyone. Any recommendations? What kind of situations are you guys facing in your environment?"

I found time to write a bit so here it goes! Remember BIL is dating now SIL and he's now thinking of marrying her. We were sitting in the room at the il's house just us three. BIL is talking to DH about it. SIL has a dog that she's had for years. It was a gift to her by her father when he became very ill, near death. The reality hit him that life is short and he decided to start making good on some of his promises before he died. He always told SIL he would get her a dog, they were a military family, and he'd always say the next place we move I'll get it for you. So he got her this dog at that time and she loves her dog and he has sentimental value to her. Now, BIL has not yet met this dog because you know it's serious when you meet the dog. BIL sates to DH: Well the dog has to go. I have allergies and I can't be living with a dog. I know the dog has sentimental meaning for her because of her dad but my health is more important than a dog. She's waiting for me to meet the dog because she wants him to slowly warm up to me. This is stupid, it's just a dog... I don't see what the big deal is. I want to marry her but if we get married we'll already have to get an apartment and that costs money there (both of them at the time were living with their parents and would meet each other for dates and such). If we keep the dog then we have to pay extra money for pet rent and I'm not paying extra money for a dog!!! DH is just nodding his head and listening (he's pretty laid back and quiet always like this guess it's true opposites attract). I'm thinking how rude is this guy? He wants to marry her and is supposed to love her but can't have compassion for what she loves??? I know he's SNOT JR. For sure. Anyway he meets the dog and they get engaged. They have all these big events that I find my way out of because I can't stand being around them. They had a family celebration right after he proposed and a joint couple shower. SNW knows how creative and crafty I am, especially after my wonderful diy wedding decor, so she asks me to help her decorate for the rehearsal dinner. I reluctantly agree to help her. DH and I have been married over 3 years at this point. SNW has never made any efforts to call, text, smoke signal, or communicate with me in any way or form any relationship with me. Can't remember if I posted about this before but I did invite her to an event to be the bigger person, but she basically fought me even giving it to her. The event was based on a book and I wanted to buy her the book and put the tickets inside as a Christmas gift. She was like oh I don't want a book. And then proceeded to text DH about how she doesn't want whatever I'm trying to get her, that he knows the type of gifts she likes and to stick to that. I was so angry... I was raised knowing when people get you a gift you accept because the person thought about you and took their time to get it for you so be grateful! Guess not everyone learned that. I still invite her after my moms advise but said well I was trying to do this for you but since you didn't want it I'm asking you now would you like to go with me. Then she's like oh I would love to go I had no idea thats what it was, super nice in front of everyone. We went to the event and she straight up did not talk to me the whole time and went off in her own during the intermissions. Sorry for going off topic but you get the point. Now all of a sudden she's blowing me up about this wedding rehearsal. She texts several times a day and calls about her ideas and sends me pics. She's always like Hi how are you then goes for what she wants... I'm not fooled at all, she never cared how I was doing for over three years. She says Oh well SIL and I have been talking about the plans and blah blah blah. Basically trying to run in my face that she talks to SIL all the time and she's being involved in the planning. unlike with my wedding, but that's because she got mad at me for not doing what she wanted and did CBF the rest of the time I was planning. I tell DH about this sudden change of behavior and how much involved SNW is in this wedding as compared to ours. He suggests well maybe because she has a good relationship with SIL she realizes she needs to do better with you and this is her way of reaching out to you... I say maybe but I know its all fake..."

It's Curry in the sense that it's his team. The system doesn't function if he's not there, and everything's been built to account for his overwhelming offensive presence. It's Draymond in the sense that he's the pillar of the system that makes everything flow and allows us to run so many good lineups on the floor. I think if you replace Curry with another star guard (anyone as good as Westbrook/Harden down to Walker or Thomas) we're still the best team in the league. If you replace Draymond with a standard PF we don't go 73-9 and we probably struggle in a Bo7 against Cleveland or the Clippers"

He had Ron Paul bumper stickers in his luggage, as well as other materials. The relevance is that 1 month ago in Missouri, the Missouri Information Awareness Center (a department of homeland security 'fusion' center where local, state, and federal law enforcement 'share' information and other resources) put out a report regarding the modern militia movement as it pertains to domestic terrorism. In one passage of this document, it stated that supporters of 3rd party political candidates (including Ron Paul, though he technically is an R) are more likely to be militia members. This is also relevant, because the incident took place in St. Louis, Missouri.

Tonight, at 10pm, my store closed. I cashed out my last customer. As I handed her the receipt, another guy walks in, past the automatic doors that were put on halfway open to accommodate my last customer. My shift lead is standing by the doors, keys in hand. ""Sir,"" my shift lead calls after him, ""it's 10 o clock, we are closed."" ""Oh, I know, I'll only be a sec!"" Guy keeps walking back towards the pet stuff. My shift lead lets my last customer out, and stands by the doors, and I can see she's fuming. Here comes Special Guy. ""See! I was only a second! Haha!"" Special Guy literally puffs out his chest with pride. I ring up his 15 big cans of dog food, and bag them in his gross smelling bag. I tell him his total, he pays, and he's watching both of us, and we are less than thrilled with him. ""Geez, ladies, lighten up! I was only a second!"" My shift lead shakes her head. ""Yes, but you're cutting into our closing ops, and yes, 5 minutes DOES make a difference."" She unlocks the doors to let him out, bidding him adieu. And his parting words to us? ""I was only a second though! Good night!"" Good lord, dude. We are open 14 hours; you had all damn day! Also, before my head gets bitten off, I'm aware some people work doubles or long shifts; I am one of them (my other job).

Rotations are seemingly pulled out of a hat, guys are playing 14 straight minutes then sitting entire halves, our efficient players barely touch the ball while inefficient guys iso and chuck, we lose any semblance of an offensive system late in games, we turn the ball over like crazy, and our defense sucks. I know we're young. I know it's a long season. But nothing about the way the Denver Nuggets have played this year has inspired any confidence in Michael Malone's ability to gameplan, distribute minutes, or adjust on the fly. He just hasn't done a good job this year so far, even disregarding wins and losses. I'm still rooting for him, but I'm less certain that he'll succeed than I was in September."

0,255 is not the max round in zombies in spaceland!,U_already_know_who,CODZombies,,1,-1,-1,2016-12,19/12/2016 13:15,"why round 255 is max zombie round also for those of you that are curious as to why 255 is the highest round I'll explain that right now call of duty games in games in general are coded with C sharp and c++ if you know what that is that's okay C++ and C sharp gets their values using hexadecimal coding and in hexadecimal coding it's 1298 to F F being the strongest value you can see on screen and hexadecimal is in force lots of two so for example like 0000 0000 but they can be any combination up to the highest combination of FF FF FF FF hopefully you guys are following this 255 is f so what would one section of the greatest value F F is 255 which means when they coded this game and they set the round limit they only set the value to the highest single number that you can achieve in hexadecimal coating which is f I have given you the number 255 I have tried to end around 255 but all that happens is it gives me the 1,000 points for ending the round and it goes back to 255 people see this often with the trends that rounds get back in the day and this is the explanation explaining why the round doesn't go to 256 something for you glitchers out there who have achieved lots of kills in a game and wondered why after a while you see your kills go back down to zero or like you know if you have a high around like 130 is plus while you're back at like you know couple thousand kills the reason why that is because your kills reset on your scoreboard at 65535 the reason for this is when they set the cap of kills you can achieve on your scar on your scoreboard in a game 65535 they only coated that to two sections of the highest value so f F F F in hexadecimal coating gives you the value of 65535 this is just for people who have asked me this question many times is likewise the highest round cap"

As for terrorism, every act of terrorism is a tragedy but none of the people who committed the terrorist acts since he became president were here as a result of the Obama administration. The largest amount of death from terrorism happened in America hundred George W. Bush on September 11, 2001. Racial relations definitely need some work here in America, but to say that they are a pre-1960 level is preposterous.

John McAfee, who created it and is brilliant, sold the company for millions, basically retired and ex-patriot-ed himself to do whatever he felt like at the moment (which apparently included lots of drugs and hookers). After he sold it, the company that bought it (forget who) turned the antivirus into a bloated piece of shit which under-performed, and wormed its way into your OS to a point where you basically couldn't get rid of it. This is McAfee's fuck-you to the company that took his product and made his name into a joke in the IT community. In other words, McAfee got based."

However, I think we need to take a moment to realize how 'lucky' we are. When we were all fucking around with computers at super young ages, we weren't doing it because ""we wanted to get a great job with good job outlook and high salaries"" We did it because we had a passion. Most people find their careers, this career found us. If you were me, you got there because all the porn you kept torrenting off Limewire. Nothing was worse than a family member logging in on our shared new fancy, gazillion dollar, computer back then talking about 'Error with file 18 year old whore blast her b-hole with Louisville slugger'. I'd be damned if that was a convo with my dad explaining that more than once, and even more damned if I missed out. When parents all got their kids computers in the 1990's / early 2000's, they didn't realize the internet was like a digital Vegas, except instead of herpes coming back with you, you'd come back with the ""I love you"" virues. It might of been that copy of the Sims you wanted to play really bad and couldn't afford so you torrent it. It finally downloads, you go to activate it and it pukes DLL errors. Next thing you know you we learning what a registry was, DLLs, how to remove viruses. We didn't do this because 'if you know this you can get a high paying in demand job and live and be pretty set the rest of your life'. I did it because 13 year old me wanted to, burn houses down in my pirated version of SIMS, watch teen girls finger fuck themselves, and listen to Eminem rap about killing his ex wife in an MP3 I got off Napster that my parents would die if they heard. People would give anything to be skilled in high a demand and pays well. Don't take it for granted. We piss and moan but, at the end of the day, you don't get to the level we are at with 4 years of college. We all started learning our trade very very early. Most doctors didn't start learning things related to their field when they were our age. The only difference between me and the Starbucks Barista with a bachelors degree in Art is luck. I'm sure they were super passionate about Art, had drive, and loved it. Enough to the point that they took out 10's of thousands of dollars in loans. No one even knew, that back then, what we loved, would be come successful careers. It just so happens we fell into the right path. Don't forget where you came from."

I disagree with quota hiring because every hire should be made on the basis of merit at the time of appointment. So yes, it may be that quotas do lead to some women being hired to positions for which they are not the best-qualified candidate. But even that is just supposition. And it doesn't mean there are no talented women (really?); just that by-and-large women and men tend to have slightly different talents and inclinations. What we need is equality of opportunity, and a willingness not to stereotype on the basis of aggregate behaviours, rather than equality of outcome. By far my best ever boss was a woman: calm, collected, fair, highly-competent, and treated everyone with respect. There are lots of good, intelligent women out there doing good work. And women are not the enemy. We'll just end up as warped and bitter as feminists if we go down that path."
